In response, access to the Safety Module staking pool was temporarily removed from [dydx.community](https://dydx.community/).\n\nFollowing the Safety Module outage, the dYdX Foundation released a detailed [incident report](https://dydx.foundation/blog/en/outage-1) explaining the cause of the error, the impact to users, a proposed solution, and lessons learned.\n\nAfter robust discussion on the Forums, a community member launched a 5-day poll on Snapshot regarding one aspect of the fix: reimbursing stakers for rewards they did not receive due to the error. The results of the poll are available [here](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/QmbJ5QxHr1pyShKTDaF5DjAr6vxQn8DVxshH2fyWgzDCBn). A minimum of 10K DYDX tokens was required to submit this off-chain proposal.\n\nIn aggregate, 575 DYDX token holders and delegates voted with 17,112,789 DYDX. With 413 voters and 16,682,487.634 DYDX (97.4855% of total) in agreement, there was an overwhelming consensus that stakers should receive 10% of their staked DYDX to make them whole.\n\n\n\n**Specification**\n\nThe Safety Module will be reset to a clean slate. Staking and earning of rewards will become active as soon as the fix is executed by governance. Users affected by the bug will receive funds via a separate Recovery Contract.\n\n***Reimbursement***\n\nThere are currently ~157,459 DYDX staked to the Safety Pool from 56 unique stakers. No staked funds were lost. Stakers will receive their funds via the Recovery Contract.\n\n***Additional Reimbursement***\n\nThose 56 stakers who were affected by the bug will receive an additional 15,746 DYDX, pro-rata, to make them whole. This will be paid out from the Rewards Treasury, and claimable by stakers through the same Recovery Contract. There will be no lockup on these funds.\n\nEach staker will need to call the claim() function directly on the Recovery Contract to receive their funds. They may then decide if they want to re-stake in the Safety Module.\n\n***Smart Contract Implementations:***\n\n\n\n1. The [Recovery Contract](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/safety/v2/helpers/SM2Recovery.sol) will be deployed with a hardcoded mapping from address to DYDX token amount. This amount should include the amount that was staked by that address, plus the additional 10%.\n    1. As a precaution, this contract will be upgradeable via the [Short Timelock](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters).\n2. The new [SafetyModuleV2](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/safety/v2/SafetyModuleV2.sol) implementation will be deployed with the following changes:\n    1. A new initializer function which:\n        1. Calls transfer() to send all held DYDX to the specified Recovery Contract address.\n        2. Calls transferFrom() to send the specified additional amount from the rewards treasury to the specified Recovery Contract address.\n        3. Restores functionality to the Safety Module by setting the correct exchange rate.\n        4. Deletes data set by the original initializer, which is now garbage due to the shift in the storage layout.\n    2. Updates DISTRIBUTION_END to account for the delayed start to the Safety Module rewards.\n    3. Updates getRevision() to return a value of 2.\n\nThe on-chain proposal to be approved by governance will include the following transaction to be executed via the [Long Timelock](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters):\n\n\n\n* Call upgradeAndCall() on the Safety Module [Proxy Admin](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/dependencies/open-zeppelin/ProxyAdmin.sol) contract, to atomically perform the following:\n    1. Upgrade the Safety Module to use the new implementation contract.\n    2. Run the initializer function with the agreed amount and Recovery Contract address.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nDifferent approaches were considered as to how to handle the funds that had already been staked. The “clean slate” approach of resetting the Safety Module is recommended as we believe it is the simplest and safest solution from a technical perspective.\n\nDiscussion on the forums has so far centered around two main issues:\n\n\n\n* **The need for the Safety Module fix to be passed as soon as possible:** Reaching community consensus and implementing a quick solution will allow affected addresses to recover their funds, and allow everyone to access the Safety staking pool. The Safety Module adds an additional safeguard to the protocol. It should be noted that Safety Module contract upgrades must use the long timelock, which imposes a minimum 18 day period (~1 day voting delay, 10 days voting duration, and 7 day timelock) between when a proposal is created and when it takes effect. In addition, long timelock proposals require a minimum quorum of 100 million DYDX (10% of the total supply) in order to pass. This means any solution will require broad community support as well as governance participation from dYdX investor token holders. For these reasons, it is imperative that the community approve this DIP in its simplest form as soon as possible.\n* **The amount to offer affected addresses to make them whole:** Staked DYDX tokens have been locked in the smart contract since September 7, and remain locked until a fix is implemented by governance. Given that the Staking Module only processes withdrawals on an epoch basis (every 28 days), the staked tokens would have been locked at a minimum for the remainder of the epoch. The community generally agreed that it was reasonable to make stakers whole due to this error. Consensus evolved around the need to repay stakers for the amount they reasonably could have expected to earn by staking over an epoch, plus some damages. 10% of the amount staked for each affected address is a reasonable and simple policy.\n\n**Test Cases**\n\nThe Safety Module has a full suite of [unit tests](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/tree/master/test/safety-module) providing 100% code coverage. The proposed fix was simulated in both a local and forked mainnet environment. The test suite was then run, to ensure that full functionality will be restored, following the execution of the governance proposal on mainnet.\n\nIn addition to unit testing, thorough validation was performed on the mainnet state to ensure that we have a thorough and accurate understanding of both the current smart contract state on mainnet and the precise nature of the bug. This validation included checking all smart contract [state](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/test/safety-module/state.spec.ts) and [logs](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/test/safety-module/events.spec.ts), verification of the contract [bytecode](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/test/safety-module/bytecode.spec.ts), and detailed analysis of [storage slots](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/test/safety-module/storage-slots.spec.ts), including those that are not directly accessible by the contract. All test and deploy scripts are open-sourced in the dYdX Foundation [governance contracts](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts) repository.\n\n[Detailed instructions](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/safety/README.md) are provided on GitHub to allow anybody to run the same tests.\n\n**Implementation**\n\nA [full implementation](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/tree/master/contracts/safety/v2) is open-sourced in the dYdX Foundation governance contracts repository.\n\n**Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThe purpose of this DIP is to change the weight of the fee parameter from `a=0.67` to `a=0.8`, and decreasing the open interest parameter from `b=0.28` to `b=0.15` in the trader rewards formula, which we expect will lead to an increase in fees paid and a decrease in average open interest in each epoch. The dYdX Community voted and approved these changes via a Snapshot vote that concluded on April 23, 2022.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe dYdX Grants Program [funded](https://dydxgrants.com/funded-grants/approved-grants/rewards-optimization-research-and-paper) [Xenophon Labs](https://xenophonlabs.com/) to conduct [research](https://xenophonlabs.com/dydx_trade_rewards.pdf) into the dYdX trader rewards mechanism. In addition to demonstrating provably optimal rewards-maximizing trading strategies, we found that cumulative fees paid by the protocol are approximately linear in the fee weight parameter `a`. We also find that incentivizing open interest has not made a tangible impact on long-term protocol growth. Therefore, we propose an increase in the fee weight parameter `a` and a decrease in the open interest parameter `b`.\n\nWe submitted a snapshot vote on April 18 2022 to conclude on April 23 2022. The Snapshot vote concluded with 8.2M DYDX voting \"Yes\" and 1.7M DYDX voting \"NO\". The majority of the community (312 voters & 82.51%) supported to change the formula. This passes the quorum and consensus requirements for an off-chain proposal.\n\n## Motivation / Rationale\n\nOur research suggests that dYdX is leaving money on the table by giving open interest such a high weight in the trader rewards formula. This change is an effort to generate more revenue for the protocol. Specifically, we expect revenues to increase 20\\%, which at current prices would lead to an increase in trading fees paid of approximately \\$3M per epoch. For a more in-depth summary, see the post [here](https://forums.dydx.community/discussion/4190-discussion-dydx-trader-rewards-mechanism-review); for the research itself, see the research paper [here](https://xenophonlabs.com/dydx_trade_rewards.pdf).\n\n### Important Objections\n* Stakeholders who believe open interest parameter is more important than exchange revenues should vote `no` on this proposal.\n* Stakeholders who are currently maximizing their trader rewards will receive lower returns-per-fees-paid, however they will *also* not need to carry out as much open interest as before. How this affects their rewards-profit maximizing behavior is up to them to decide.\n\n\n## Specification\nAll relevant terms are defined in [dYdX's community documentation](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/rewards/trading-rewards#:~:text=DYDX%20will%20be%20distributed%20to,to%20any%20vesting%20or%20lockups.).\n\n\n## Implementation\n\n\ndYdX smart contracts do not directly control the trader rewards mechanism. If approved, the dYdX Foundation will request that dYdX Trading Inc. implement the changes in time for Epoch 10 (May 10, 2022).\n\nThis change should be rather simple to implement, and it is entirely off-chain.\n1. Increase the fee weight parameter `a` from `a=0.67` to `a=0.8`.\n2. Decrease the open interest weight parameter `b` from `b=0.28` to `b=0.15`.\n\n## Relevant Links\n* [Forum Discussion](https://forums.dydx.community/discussion/4190-discussion-dydx-trader-rewards-mechanism-review)\n* [Snapshot Vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0xce4b1334f337975a42c3f78dd16fb25e0b60e816a2d9382e402b5384bea37475)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThe purpose of this DIP is to implement maker volume into the calculation of liquidity provider rewards, as well as reduce the weight of depth, spread and stkDYDX. This should in theory provide a more equitable distribution of rewards and incentivize LP compeition, while creating a better trading environment for users.\n\n## Abstract\n\ndYdX’s liquidity provider reward program is dominated by two liquidity providers earning +90% of rewards every Epoch. While dYdX incentivizes for depth, spread, uptime and protocol alignment, market makers are not incentivized to compete for market share. This composition of market structure is detrimental to the longevity of dYdX as it produces a sub-optimal trading environment (large spreads) and discourages entrants (rewards are cornered due to size and stkDYDX). \n\nThe Snapshot vote concluded with 553 unique voters and a total of 18,263,364 DYDX voted. The overwhelming majority of the community (539 & 99.97% of DYDX) were in favor of moving forward with this proposal.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, dYdX rewards LPs for showing size and not their ability to compete for market share. This is done by:\n- Rewarding depth with increasing returns to scale, allowing LPs who have huge size sit passively in the orderbook and earn large amounts of rewards.\n- Largely reward stkDYDX with increasing returns to scale, allowing LPs with a big stkDYDX balance to compound their rewards as opposed to new entrants who need significant capital outlay to compete.\n\nThis deters new MM's from competiting as the current reward scheme is dominated by 2 LPs. This is not sustainable for one of the largest derivative protocols. Futhermore, by not incentivizing LPs to compete for market share there is less liquidity at the top of the order book which is not ideal for traders on the platform.\n\n## Specification\n\nProposed solution: \n1. Introduce maker volume into the calculation of LP rewards\n2. Reduce the weight of depth, spread and stkDYDX\n\nNew Liquidity Provider Reward Calculation:\nLet,\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105179217/167971038-8ead6700-61fd-410a-911c-6d256e7f8b2d.png)\n\nThe total rewards score for an individual LP, Qi, is then calculated as follows:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105179217/167971051-cec27e63-dac0-45bc-8195-a8fbd08ed87a.png)\n\nNote:\nIn the original formula stkDYDX is defined as:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105179217/167971084-261f87b5-6c5b-4453-9fc2-ffc0be53cc68.png)\n\nrepresenting an LP’s average stkDYDX score as a proportion of the total pool of stkDYDX. However, given that “Total Pool stkDYDX” is constant across all LPs it simply scales each LP’s score. Therefore,\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105179217/167971099-78235ec4-0f0d-481b-bf29-d617ced539dc.png)\n\nis equivalent. This is true for uptime and maker volume as well.\n\nConstant Returns to Scale:\nThe new weightings are constructed to have constant returns to scale i.e.,\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105179217/167971164-c5b650e7-e251-4f4e-97c6-2648f1193b8a.png)\n\nThis ensures that if an LP were to split their activity in half across two addresses, they would receive half of their share of rewards in each address and therefore, the same total amount of rewards. Originally, d = 1, v = 0, and s =0.5 producing increasing returns to scale. This advantages large players and incentives combining activity in a single address. For example, doubling the depth posted and stkDYDX results in more than twice the reward share currently.\n\n## Rationale\n\nIntroducing maker volume rewards active liquidity, pushing current liquidity closer to ‘desired’ liquidity by inviting competition towards the top of the order book. Naturally, spreads become tighter as LPs fight for market share, traders receive a better trading environment, and active LPs are rewarded for facilitating flow. Weighting maker volume with the highest exponent of v = 0.45 (except uptime), should incentivize such behavior. However, when combined with a reduction in the weight of depth and spread, there is a possibility that deep/passive liquidity is overpenalized.\n\nWithout reducing the weight of depth and spread, I expect LPs with large size to continue sitting deep in the order book unless disincentivized. Reducing the exponent of Di from d = 1 to d = 0.35, forces LPs to re-optimize their strategy from passive to active as incentives get cut, once again inviting a better trading experience for users and a more equitable reward scheme amongst a variety of LPs. One concern with the aforementioned changes is the possibility of overpenalizing depth and the quality of liquidity, discouraging large traders from using dYdX. Our goal is to not strictly eliminate depth, but instead taper how much dYdX is paying for such liquidity.\n\nThe final reduction in weighting is for the stkDYDX term, from s = 0.5 to s = 0.2. Currently, stkDYDX plays a notable role in LPs receiving rewards. While a large stkDYDX balance is not necessary to achieve a substantial amount of rewards (i.e. new kid on the block), LPs with large amounts of stDYDX can afford to be ‘lazy’ and/or dominate reward share. This leads to incumbents having a major competitive advantage over entrants, and misalignment with current and desired liquidity. As early supporters, Wintermute has chosen to stake a large majority of our rewards and thus have a large stkDYDX balance. While rewarding early supporters is important and having stkDYDX in the LP calculation is beneficial for LP-protocol alignment, I think reducing the dependency on stkDYDX will allow for a more equitable distribution of rewards and increase LP participation.\n\nAlternative Weighting:\nThe proposed weights were chosen based on how desired liquidity could be achieved without overpenalizing depth, favoring an LPs ability to compete for market share as opposed to showing size. However, it’s important to consider alternative weighting:\n\nScenario 1:\nEqually weight maker volume and depth/spread:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105179217/167971277-f6b13812-3668-4a5a-acd6-a374b6783e40.png)\n\nScenario 2:\nEqual Weights w/ Reduce weight of stkDYDX (i.e., LP - Protocol Alignment):\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105179217/167971287-e15f7680-932d-4221-85f0-972967ec2d68.png)\n\nScenario 3:\nHeavily Favor Maker Volume:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105179217/167971296-bfb30a6e-5aaa-446b-bc1f-673d601ac2e9.png)\n\nScenario 4:\nHeavily Favor Depth/Spread:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105179217/167971306-b70f982d-70c7-4536-8a6a-b1d17e555685.png)\n\nGeneral Consensus:\nThe very large majority of the community were in favour of introducing maker volume and reducing the weights of stkDYDX, depth and spread. There 2 prominent arguments were the constructs of the weights: v = 0.45, d = 0.35, s = 0.2 vs. v = 0.7, d = 0.2, s = 0.1. However, the weights introduced in this proposal were seen as more appropriate given the significant change this proposal introduces in general. Futhermore, this proposal is intended to limit the amount of rewards spent on depth without trying to completely eliminate it.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

Data shows the USDC staked in the Pool is underutilized, resulting in the Community inefficiently rewarding stakers with DYDX for their staked USDC.\n\nWe expect to see a revamp of liquidity programs through new initiatives outside of the Liquidity Staking Pool.\n\nEach epoch, the 383,562 DYDX currently allocated to USDC stakers will instead accummulate in the Rewards Treasury. The dYdX community may redirect the DYDX from the Rewards Treasury with a vote falling under the requierement of the short timelock. Also, an additional proposal can be submitted to transfer the DYDX back to the Community Treasury if needed.\n\nThe snapshot vote concluded with 632 voters and 17M DYDX in agreement (99.96%).

As a result, 383, 562 DYDX are distributed pro-rata to stakers each epoch. While this had some success initially, the program is no longer an efficient allocation of DYDX for the following reasons:\n\n**1. Underutilization**\n\nThe dYdX community is currently rewarding USDC stakers with 383, 562 DYDX each epoch. Assuming DYDX is priced at $2.00, this amounts to over $767K in DYDX. Given that $193M USDC is currently unborrowed (~70%), the dYdX community is paying DYDX rewards for underutilized USDC capital.\n\n**2. Inadequate Disclosure**\n\nMost prospective borrowers have not fulfilled the disclosure requirements that the Community voted to adopt in the borrowing framework.\n\n**3. Impact on Market Structure**\n\nIn Epoch 9, the dYdX community almost unanimously supported updating the LP rewards formula to redistribute LP rewards in a more equitable manner to incentivize competition. Currently, the structure of the borrowing pool negatively impacts competition among LPs.\n\nInstead, re-allocating the remaining rewards back to the Community Treasury will allow the DAO to scale and initiate different growth programs. In addition to this, we anticipate new liquidity programs to be launched after the winding down of this Pool.\n\n## Specification\n\nUnder the implementation, DYDX will accrue in the [Rewards Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x639192D54431F8c816368D3FB4107Bc168d0E871) each epoch. The dYdX community will have control over accrued DYDX that previously would have been distributed to stakers in the liquidity module. With a governance vote DYDX held in the Rewards Treasury can be (1) sent to the Community Treasury or (2) sent directly to an Ethereum address for any Community directed purpose.\n\nThe following code changes will be approved in relation to this proposal:\n- Setting the liquidity staking pool rewards per second to 0.\n- Decreasing the length of the blackout window to three days.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe Community had expressed overwhelming support for the winding down of the Liquidity Staking Pool in discussions. We believe this to be in the best interest of the Community and protocol.\n\n## Implementation\n\nA full implementation is open-sourced on the dYdX Foundation Github: https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/pull/33\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

Each Epoch 2,876,712 will be distributed as trading rewards and the remaining 958,904 DYDX (“Excess DYDX”) that were previously allocated for distribution will accrue in the Rewards Treasury. The Excess DYDX (958,904 DYDX per epoch) that accrues in the Rewards Treasury can be used/directed by the dYdX community with a governance vote ([Short Timelock](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters))\n\n## Abstract\n\ndYdX trading rewards are the largest form of reward emissions across the platform by a significant margin, emitting 3,835,616 DYDX per epoch or roughly 50m DYDX a year. \n\nOn July 31, the Snapshot vote to reduce trading rewards by 25% concluded with the majority (22.8M DYDX (99.13%) from 532 voters) of the dYdX community that voted in support of the reduction. This proposal seeks to ratify a 25% reduction in trading rewards.\n\nRelevant Links:\n* Snapshot:\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x28193f3cc8f0a1d1a98a7c32ea4cd51b497c27b8de6bdb36208c4fd4883a0c73\n* Community Discussion:\nhttps://forums.dydx.community/discussion/6324-discussion-revisionssimplification-of-trading-rewards\n* Trading Rewards:\nhttps://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/rewards/trading-rewards\n* Rewards Treasury: https://etherscan.io/address/0x639192D54431F8c816368D3FB4107Bc168d0E871\n* Pull Request with the Proposed Update:\nhttps://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/pull/34\n\n## Motivation\n  \nIn light of ongoing depressed market conditions, the current trading reward emission schedule seems excessively high relative to the growth in platform activity. When thinking about the long-term success of dYdX and its transition to v4, it makes sense to eliminate areas of overspending in the protocol to ensure future opportunities or needs can be met. This proposal requests to reduce trading rewards by 25% every epoch for the foreseeable future, eliminating the overspending of DYDX and preserving funds for future expenditure.\n\n## Specification\nProposal Changes:\n * Reduce per-epoch trading reward emissions from 3,835,616 DYDX to 2,876,712 DYDX (Excess DYDX: 958,904)\n\nNote: Excess DYDX will accrue in the Rewards Treasury, but can be moved via an on-chain community vote\n  \n*Smart Contract Implementations:*\n* Updates setRewardsParameters for trader rewards in the Merkle Distributor to 2,876,712 per epoch\n\nThe on-chain proposal to be approved by governance will include the following transaction to be executed via the [Short Timelock](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters):\n* Update the Merkle Distributor to the new trading rewards parameters\n\n## Rationale\nThe community was largely in agreement with the reduction in trading rewards as evident by forum discussion and the passing of a snapshot vote. While there were discussions about the magnitude of reduction in trading rewards, starting with 25% was agreed upon as a reasonable start to limiting emissions and assessing the effects on trading activity.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nA full test case is provided in the implementation found [here](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/486e3f4966c4f8763ce4e4e301074fa0cd18649c/test/misc/update-merkle-distributor-rewards-parameters.spec.ts).\n\n## Implementation\n\nA [full implementation](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/pull/34) is open-sourced in the dYdX Foundation governance contracts repository.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

This spending is meant to provide insurance power for the protocol in the case of a shortfall event. However, our research suggests that the SSM is not an effective insurance fund, due to the practical difficulty of slashing the SSM, as well as the much lower value that the DYDX token would be sellable for in the case of a shortfall event, due to market contagion and lack of liquidity. While in the long term we believe the SSM should be replaced by a module with better insurance power, such as a USDC Safety Staking Module or a USDC-DYDX Balancer LP token Safety Staking Module, this would require too much of a lift for the dYdX team currently. Thus, we believe it is appropriate to halt emissions to the current SSM until we can replace it following the launch of dYdX V4.\n\n## Specification\n\nUnder the implementation, DYDX will accrue in the [Rewards Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x639192D54431F8c816368D3FB4107Bc168d0E871) each epoch.

Three Trustees and an Enforcer will be appointed to manage the responsibilities of the Trust.\n\nTo cover compensation and expenses, we are requesting a total of $360,000 in DYDX to be transferred from the Community Treasury to the Ops Trust multisig.\nThe Operations subDAO will be operational for an initial 6 month period to deliver the responsibilites outlined below.\n\nThe snapshot vote concluded with 783 voters and 7.7M DYDX in agreement (75.43%). The vote results have shown significant support for the program.\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0xa710b0ca85e04ac2db123ae522ac5030a008ccbc8d4d413e83d18f6032b39758\n\n**Relevant Links**\n\nDRC discussion: https://commonwealth.im/dydx/discussion/7620-drc-dydx-operations-trust\n\n## Motivation\n\ndYdX is facing an important decision to scale the protocol thoughtfully as it transitions to full community control. As a community, we have to look ahead towards organizational transformation through the use of subDAOs. Accomplishing this goal will first require guidance on structural implementation.\n\nSpeaking from experience with the Grants Trust, launching a subDAO is not quite as simple as opening a wallet and getting community funding. There are tons of legal procedures, operational headaches, and other nuances to building a truly internet-native organization. Community members should be able to benefit from the know-how and experience gained through the process that led to the creation and operation of the Grants Trust.\n\nTo keep up with the competitive landscape, the DAO will also need to operate quickly. Doing so will require a standardized process for launching new subDAOs in charge of important functions. The playbook to be written by the Ops Trust will give the community a thoughtful approach for quickly spinning up new subDAOs, including all legal and operational procedures necessary.\n\n## Specification\n\n**Trust Agreement**\nIf this proposal is passed, the Trust will be formed with dYdX Consent as defined in the Trust Agreement. The full agreement can be seen here:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/16ubaQpxlnmybYkoSE5ML_NkgR36EyrH0/view?usp=sharing\n\n**The subDAO will be funded for a period of 6 months**\n\nReverie will work with outside legal counsel to establish a Guernsey Purpose Trust. The Trust will be formed with the following contributors:\n\n**Trustees**\n- Reverie Reserves, LLC\n- Joanna Pope\n- Callen Van Den Elst\n\n**Enforcer**\nGeorge Beall\n\n**Responsibilities**\n- Open a fiat bank account for the Ops Trust\n- Hire and manage external legal staff for ongoing guidance\n- Payments and Financial Reporting\n- Create communication channels for the Ops Trust, as needed, which can serve as the standard dYdX DAO’s communication channel going forward\n- Build and share a DAO playbook for launching new dYdX subDAOs\n\n**Compensation and Expenses**\n- Reverie will receive **$15,000 per month** and a **$90,000 success fee** for publishing the DAO playbook\n- Joanna Pope will receive **$1,500 per month** as Trustee\n- Callen Van Den Else has waived compensation as Trustee\n- George Beall will receive **$2,000 per month** as Enforcer\n\nWe are requesting an additional **$100,000** to cover legal and operational expenses for all Ops Trust related engagements.\n\nIn total, $360,000 will be used to fund the initial 6 month operation of the Ops subDAO.\n\n\n**DYDX Amount**\n\nThe amount of DYDX to be moved from the community treasury to the Ops Trust Multisig will be determined using a 24h vwap of the trades executed on the most liquid exchange, namely Binance.com. The previous day's trades will be used to capture a full 24h window so as to avoid timing constraints. The following data file is used: https://data.binance.vision/data/spot/daily/trades/DYDXUSDT/DYDXUSDT-trades-2022-12-10.zip\n\nThis formula will be used to calculate the price: Σ(Price * Volume) / Σ(Volume).\n\nFrom the data, we find: $6,370,831.51 / 3,967,848 = $1.606.\n\nThe DYDX Amount to be transferred will be $360,000 / $1.606 = **225,000.00 DYDX** (rounded up to the nearest thousand for simplicity).\n\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe community has addressed certain concerns and issues with a dYdX Operations subDAO run by Reverie in the DRC, namely regarding possible conflicts with the existing involvement in the Grants program. Since the responsibilities of this Trust do not overlap with our responsibilities as Grants lead and Enforcer on the dYdX Grants Trust, we believe there is no conflict in our role as Trustee for the Ops Trust. Beyond these initial concerns, overall consensus has been in strong support of launching as indicated through the Snapshot vote and general positive feedback. The dYdX Ops subDAO will act as a catalyst for the growth of the dYdX DAO through the launching of new subDAOs.\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

The majority of the community (399 voters & 86% of DYDX) supported to reduce the threshold to 1%.\n\n\n\n**Relevant Links**\n\n\n* Reference to a thread on market maker incentives:[https://forums.dydx.community/proposal/discussion/1805-reduce-market-maker-incentives/](https://forums.dydx.community/proposal/discussion/1805-reduce-market-maker-incentives/)\n* Snapshot vote for DYDX holders from Su Zhu at Three Arrows Capital: [https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/QmXtS7CGVX7C5v2JdcJpsqWAeZrStQcogSQpP6zzhzwLmN](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/QmXtS7CGVX7C5v2JdcJpsqWAeZrStQcogSQpP6zzhzwLmN)\n* Maker Volume Distibution: [https://metabase.dydx.exchange/public/dashboard/5fa0ea31-27f7-4cd2-8bb0-bc24473ccaa3](https://metabase.dydx.exchange/public/dashboard/5fa0ea31-27f7-4cd2-8bb0-bc24473ccaa3)\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nHaving a high threshold of 5% is worse for liquidity on dYdX. It excludes smaller and medium-sized market makers from competing with larger market makers. \n\n5 more market makers would be included in epoch 0/1 if the threshold had been reduced to 1%.\n\n\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n Reducing this threshold from 5% to 1% will provide better competition for tight quoting and uptime (especially on alt pairs, which have had quite wide spreads) and should result in better liquidity overall across dYdX Protocol. \n\n**Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

This proposal aims to fix the Safety Module in as simple a way as possible.\n\n**Specification**\n\nThe Safety Module will be reset to a clean slate. Staking and earning of rewards will become active as soon as the fix is executed by governance.\n\n***Smart Contract Implementations:***\n\n* The new [SafetyModuleV2](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/safety/v2/SafetyModuleV2.sol) implementation will be deployed with the following changes:\n    1. A new initializer function which:\n        1. Calls transfer() to send all held DYDX to the Rewards Treasury.\n        2. Restores functionality to the Safety Module by setting the correct exchange rate.\n        3. Deletes data set by the original initializer, which is now garbage due to the shift in the storage layout.\n    2. Updates DISTRIBUTION_END to account for the delayed start to the Safety Module rewards.\n    3. Updates getRevision() to return a value of 2.\n\nThe on-chain proposal to be approved by governance will include the following transaction to be executed via the [Long Timelock](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters):\n\n\n\n* Call upgradeAndCall() on the Safety Module [Proxy Admin](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/dd1c396733a245ffb0faac15f657ace87d289b92/contracts/dependencies/open-zeppelin/ProxyAdmin.sol) contract, to atomically perform the following:\n    1. Upgrade the Safety Module to use the new implementation contract.\n    2. Run the initializer function.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nDifferent approaches were considered as to how to handle the funds that had already been staked. The “clean slate” approach of resetting the Safety Module is recommended as we believe it is the simplest and safest solution from a technical perspective.\n\nReaching community consensus and implementing a quick solution will allow recovery of the locked funds, and allow everyone access to the Safety Module staking pool. The Safety Module adds an important, additional safeguard to the protocol. It should be noted that Safety Module contract upgrades must use the long timelock, which imposes a minimum 18 day period (~1 day voting delay, 10 days voting duration, and 7 day timelock) between when a proposal is created and when it takes effect. In addition, long timelock proposals require a minimum quorum of 100 million DYDX (10% of the total supply) in order to pass. This means any solution will require broad community support as well as governance participation from dYdX investor token holders. For these reasons, it is imperative that the community approve this DIP in its simplest form as soon as possible.\n\n**Test Cases**\n\nThe Safety Module has a full suite of [unit tests](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/tree/master/test/safety-module) providing 100% code coverage. The proposed fix was simulated in both a local and forked mainnet environment. The test suite was then run, to ensure that full functionality will be restored, following the execution of the governance proposal on mainnet.\n\nIn addition to unit testing, thorough validation was performed on the mainnet state to ensure that we have a thorough and accurate understanding of both the current smart contract state on mainnet and the precise nature of the bug. This validation included checking all smart contract [state](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/test/safety-module/state.spec.ts) and [logs](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/test/safety-module/events.spec.ts), verification of the contract [bytecode](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/test/safety-module/bytecode.spec.ts), and detailed analysis of [storage slots](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/test/safety-module/storage-slots.spec.ts), including those that are not directly accessible by the contract. All test and deploy scripts are open-sourced in the dYdX Foundation [governance contracts](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts) repository.\n\n[Detailed instructions](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/safety/README.md) are provided on GitHub to allow anybody to run the same tests.\n\n**Implementation**\n\nA [full implementation](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/tree/master/contracts/safety/v2) is open-sourced in the dYdX Foundation governance contracts repository.\n\n**Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

The results of the poll are available [here](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/QmbJ5QxHr1pyShKTDaF5DjAr6vxQn8DVxshH2fyWgzDCBn). In aggregate, 575 DYDX token holders and delegates voted with 17,112,789 DYDX. With 413 voters and 16,682,487.634 DYDX (97.4855% of total) in agreement, there was an overwhelming consensus that stakers should receive 10% of their staked DYDX to make them whole.\n\n**Specification**\n\nUsers affected by the Safety Module outage will receive funds via a Recovery Contract. The same contract that was deployed as part of the DIP-1 implementation will be used.\n\n***Reimbursement***\n\nThere are currently ~157,459 DYDX staked to the Safety Pool from 56 unique stakers. These funds are recoverable by governance via the long timelock.\n\nThis DIP specifies that action be taken via the **short timelock** to withdraw the same amount of DYDX from the Rewards Treasury to fund the Recovery Contract. This allows the stakers to get their funds back sooner.\n\n***Additional Reimbursement***\n\nThose 56 stakers who were affected by the bug will receive an additional 15,746 DYDX, pro-rata, to make them whole. This will be paid out from the Rewards Treasury, and claimable by stakers through the same Recovery Contract. There will be no lockup on these funds.\n\nEach staker will need to call the claim() function directly on the Recovery Contract to receive their funds. They may then decide if they want to re-stake in the Safety Module.\n\n***Smart Contract Implementations:***\n\n* The [Recovery Contract](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/safety/v2/helpers/SM2Recovery.sol) will be deployed with a hardcoded mapping from address to DYDX token amount. This amount should include the amount that was staked by that address, plus the additional 10%.\n    * As a precaution, this contract will be upgradeable via the [Short Timelock](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters).\n\nThe on-chain proposal to be approved by governance will include the following transaction to be executed via the [Short Timelock](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters):\n\n* Call transfer() on the [Rewards Treasury](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/336cb686b0c50693639a0fdb639d0b8f3b0670b3/contracts/treasury/Treasury.sol) contract, to transfer ~15,746 DYDX to the [Recovery Contract](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/336cb686b0c50693639a0fdb639d0b8f3b0670b3/contracts/safety/v2/helpers/SM2Recovery.sol) which was previously deployed to `0xF3f6e3fad2D453ca0Ce3c8580ecBE801F04c5662`.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nStaked DYDX tokens have been locked in the smart contract since September 7, and remain locked until a fix is implemented by governance. Given that the Staking Module only processes withdrawals on an epoch basis (every 28 days), the staked tokens would have been locked at a minimum for the remainder of the epoch. The community generally agreed that it was reasonable to make stakers whole due to this error. Consensus evolved around the need to repay stakers for the amount they reasonably could have expected to earn by staking over an epoch, plus some damages. 10% of the amount staked for each affected address is a reasonable and simple policy.\n\n**Test Cases**\n\nThe recovery contract implementation, as well as test and deploy scripts, were open-sourced in the dYdX Foundation [governance contracts](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts) repository. The reimbursement process was thoroughly tested in both test and mainnet fork environments.\n\n[Detailed instructions](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/safety/README.md) are provided on GitHub to allow anybody to run the same tests.\n\n**Implementation**\n\nA [full implementation](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/tree/master/contracts/safety/v2) is open-sourced in the dYdX Foundation governance contracts repository.\n\n**Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nUpgrade StarkProxy smart contracts to support deposit cancellation and recovery.\n\n## Abstract\n\nWhen depositing USDC to the dYdX Layer 2 exchange, the funds are held in a bridge contract while waiting for the deposit to be processed by the L2 sequencer and prover. While funds are on the bridge awaiting confirmation, the depositor can initiate a time-locked recovery process to cancel the deposit. This functionality is not currently supported by the Stark Proxy smart contracts which manage the funds borrowed by market makers from the Liquidity Module staking pool. These Stark Proxy smart contracts should be upgraded to support deposit cancelation and recovery.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOn October 27, 2021 09:37:37 AM +UTC, we (Wintermute) borrowed 50 million USDC (transaction [here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa9cc82d4d8e6360538bb3c61e91a6c2494d98d7644d4516b0456a8008dad0e47)) from the [Liquidity Staking Pool](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/staking-pools/liquidity-staking-pool) and attempted to deposit the funds to our trading account on the dYdX exchange. We had to send deposit programmatically because the client provided by the dYdX Foundation team does not support wallet-connect yet. Unfortunately, the wrong “vaultId” parameter was passed in the call to “depositToExchange” (transaction [here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe6a1130a56abf62a076ef4210a28da20e06226295b54fc52b89a6b61850dca8e)). Because this “vaultId” did not correspond to our STARK key, the deposit was invalid and could not be confirmed on L2.\nThe 50M USDC are safely held by the dYdX L2 exchange smart contract and can be reclaimed by the StarkProxy contract. However, to reclaim the funds, the StarkProxy contract must call “depositCancel” and “depositReclaim” on the L2 exchange smart contract. \nUpgrading these smart contracts would allow us to recover the 50M USDC and ensure that other market makers can safely make use of the Liquidity Staking Pool.\n\nFollowing a forum DRC [thread](https://forums.dydx.community/proposal/discussion/2437-drc-smart-contract-upgrade-for-market-maker-borrowers-from-liquidity-staking-pool/), Wintermute launched a 5-day poll on Snapshot regarding the question of Stark Proxy upgrade. The results of the poll are available [here](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x3d62d5b77b2b9bd3ab1c42c296cc36ccf89f77bea22815081e785d5d28d32366). The Snapshot vote has concluded with 5.3M DYDX (99.92%) from 474 voters indicating consensus in favor of the DRC. \n\n## Specification\n\nWhen market makers borrow funds from the Liquidity Module staking pool they must do so via a StarkProxy smart contract which manages the funds and limits how they may be used. The StarkProxy borrows funds from the pool using a “borrow” call and then deposits those to the exchange using “depositToExchange” providing multiple parameters in transaction data describing which account should be credited. This deposit transaction transfers funds to the dYdX L2 exchange smart contract ([here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd54f502e184b6b739d7d27a6410a67dc462d69c8)) and, if a deposit is valid, it is submitted and confirmed on L2. If the deposit parameters are misspecified by the caller, it may not be possible to credit the deposit. In such a case, as long as the “starkKey” was correctly specified in the deposit, the depositor can reclaim their funds using the “depositCancel” and “depositReclaim” functions. This process is described [here](https://docs.starkware.co/starkex-v3/starkex-deep-dive/smart-contracts-1/public-interactions#deposit).\nSince “depositCancel” and “depositReclaim” are not currently implemented on the StarkProxy contract, it is not possible for those contracts to reclaim funds in the case where a deposit transaction is malformed and unable to be processed. \nCurrently there is one such invalid deposit of 50M USDC which must be canceled in order for the funds to be recovered and put to use. The deposit is invalid because the wrong vault number was used, and the vault number and stark key specified in the deposit transaction do not match.\n  \n**Implementation**\n\nUpgraded Stark Proxy implementation [Stark Proxy V2](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/stark-proxy/README.md) is open-sourced in the dYdX Foundation governance contracts repository.\n\n\n**Test Cases**\n\nTest cases for Stark Proxy have been extended to cover new V2 functions. It is open-sourced in the dYdX Foundation [Stark Proxy tests](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/tree/master/test/stark-proxy) folder. The deposit and cancelation process was thoroughly tested in both test and mainnet fork environments.\n\n[Detailed instructions](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/stark-proxy/README.md) are provided on GitHub to allow anybody to run the same tests.\n\n**Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

This contributor growth will lead to improvements across both user experiences and the overall community.\n\n## Specification\n\n**Program Design**\n\n* $3m DYDX Funding per quarter for two quarters\n* 1 Full Time Lead\n* 8 Committee Members\n* Committee Member held Multi-Sig\n\nThe treasury will move $6.25m worth of DYDX to the Committee Member multi-sig.\n\nFunds will be used to reward Grantees, pay the Lead and cover additional program costs. Grantees will be subject to milestones that can determine compensation structure, with standard payouts being 25% upfront and the remainder upon completion.\n\n**DYDX Amount**\n\nThe amount of DYDX to be moved from the community treasury to the DGP Multisig will be determined using a 24h vwap of the trades executed on the most liquid exchange, namely Binance.com. Given it makes up roughly 30% of the 24h volume, the DYDX/USDT Binance market data will be used to derive a market price. The data will be pulled from https://data.binance.vision/?prefix=data/spot/daily/trades/DYDXUSDT/. The previous day's trades will be used to capture a full 24h window so as to avoid timing constraints. As such, we will use the following data set: https://data.binance.vision/data/spot/daily/trades/DYDXUSDT/DYDXUSDT-trades-2022-01-01.zip.\n\nThis formula will be used to calculate the price: Σ(Price * Volume) / Σ(Volume).\n\nFrom the data above, we find: $16,199,143.30 / 1,949,010.42 = $8.31.\n\nThe DYDX Amount to be transferred will be $6,250,000 / $8.31 = **752000.00** (rounded up to the nearest thousand for simplicity).\n\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe community has addressed certain concerns and issues with a Grants program in the DRC, but overall consensus has been in strong support of launching. The program will make productive use of treasury funds to promote the protocol and engage contributors. Promoting external tools and analytics dashboards, among other projects, will improve the product experience and should lead to user growth. The program will also attract third party providers and other institutional teams that can build bridges and relevant tools to improve governance and trading experiences.\nGrants programs have been successful to grow an active contributor base and benefit the underlying protocol. We hope to bring this same positive growth to dYdX with this program.\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nTo better incentivize utility of the DYDX token, usage of the dYdX ecosystem, and to protect the protocol through increased adoption of the Safety Staking Pool, the dYdX Foundation proposed to adjust the formulas for Trading Rewards and Liquidity Provider Rewards to both include holding of stkDYDX. The dYdX Community voted and approved these changes via a Snapshot vote that concluded on December 20, 2021.\n\n## Abstract\n\nIn response to a thread that the dYdX Foundation posted proposing these changes, a community member submitted a snapshot vote on December 15, 2021 to conclude on December 20, 2021.\n\nThe Snapshot vote concluded with 864.64K DYDX voting “Yes” and 1.54K DYDX voting “No.” 316 unique addresses voted in the snapshot. The majority of the community (312 voters & 99.82% of DYDX) supported to change the formulas.\n\nRelevant Links:\nForum discussion proposing the update: https://forums.dydx.community/proposal/discussion/2940-drc-update-trading-liquidity-provider-rewards-formulas-to-include-holding-of-stkdydx/\n\nSnapshot vote: https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0xfbcb8104dc469cae09727dea89577f89b37df784c3ef2715b26ab77e9ae15161\n\n## Motivation\n\nIt is quite clear that the existing liquidity mining programs have been extremely successful in incentivizing onboarding and usage of the dYdX protocol since its inception. However, the liquidity mining programs do not currently incentivize users to remain participants in the dYdX ecosystem. This proposal aims to address this issue.\n\n## Rationale\n\nBy including stkDYDX as variables in the Trading Rewards and Liquidity Provider Reward formulas, the community can better convert dYdX protocol users to become long term participants in the dYdX ecosystem and, ultimately, contributors to the protocol while further protecting the protocol from existential black-swan events via increasing the size of the Safety Staking Pool.\n\n## Implementation\n\nDYDX smart contracts do not directly control the liquidity mining formulas. If approved, the dYdX Foundation will request that dYdX Trading Inc. implement the changes in time for Epoch 5.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

The majority of the community (195 voters & 99.8% of DYDX) supported to reduce the threshold to 0.25%.\n\n## Relevant Links:\n\nSnapshot vote for DYDX holders: https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x785066561be1e5d170eb28960da5ef2643ee0d0c3d590fd797c028512cc6be43\n\nMaker Volume Distribution: https://metabase.dydx.exchange/public/dashboard/5fa0ea31-27f7-4cd2-8bb0-bc24473ccaa3\n\nDiscussions: https://forums.dydx.community/discussion/3683-drc-reduce-the-threshold-for-receiving-liquidity-provider-rewards\n\n## Motivation\n\nHaving a high threshold of 1% is worse for liquidity on dYdX. It excludes smaller and small-sized market makers from competing with larger market makers.\n\n28 more market makers would be included in the next epoch if the threshold had been reduced to 0.25%.\n\n## Rationale\n\nReducing this threshold from 1% to 0.25% will provide better competition for tight quoting and uptime (especially on alt pairs, which have had quite wide spreads) and should result in better liquidity overall across dYdX Protocol.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

This move will also help the program scale through off-chain agreements and payments to US based grantees.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",
