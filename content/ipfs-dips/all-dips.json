In response, access to the Safety Module staking pool was temporarily removed from [dydx.community](https://dydx.community/).\n\nFollowing the Safety Module outage, the dYdX Foundation released a detailed [incident report](https://dydx.foundation/blog/en/outage-1) explaining the cause of the error, the impact to users, a proposed solution, and lessons learned.\n\nAfter robust discussion on the Forums, a community member launched a 5-day poll on Snapshot regarding one aspect of the fix: reimbursing stakers for rewards they did not receive due to the error. The results of the poll are available [here](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/QmbJ5QxHr1pyShKTDaF5DjAr6vxQn8DVxshH2fyWgzDCBn). A minimum of 10K DYDX tokens was required to submit this off-chain proposal.\n\nIn aggregate, 575 DYDX token holders and delegates voted with 17,112,789 DYDX. With 413 voters and 16,682,487.634 DYDX (97.4855% of total) in agreement, there was an overwhelming consensus that stakers should receive 10% of their staked DYDX to make them whole.\n\n\n\n**Specification**\n\nThe Safety Module will be reset to a clean slate. Staking and earning of rewards will become active as soon as the fix is executed by governance. Users affected by the bug will receive funds via a separate Recovery Contract.\n\n***Reimbursement***\n\nThere are currently ~157,459 DYDX staked to the Safety Pool from 56 unique stakers. No staked funds were lost. Stakers will receive their funds via the Recovery Contract.\n\n***Additional Reimbursement***\n\nThose 56 stakers who were affected by the bug will receive an additional 15,746 DYDX, pro-rata, to make them whole. This will be paid out from the Rewards Treasury, and claimable by stakers through the same Recovery Contract. There will be no lockup on these funds.\n\nEach staker will need to call the claim() function directly on the Recovery Contract to receive their funds. They may then decide if they want to re-stake in the Safety Module.\n\n***Smart Contract Implementations:***\n\n\n\n1. The [Recovery Contract](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/safety/v2/helpers/SM2Recovery.sol) will be deployed with a hardcoded mapping from address to DYDX token amount. This amount should include the amount that was staked by that address, plus the additional 10%.\n    1. As a precaution, this contract will be upgradeable via the [Short Timelock](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters).\n2. The new [SafetyModuleV2](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/safety/v2/SafetyModuleV2.sol) implementation will be deployed with the following changes:\n    1. A new initializer function which:\n        1. Calls transfer() to send all held DYDX to the specified Recovery Contract address.\n        2. Calls transferFrom() to send the specified additional amount from the rewards treasury to the specified Recovery Contract address.\n        3. Restores functionality to the Safety Module by setting the correct exchange rate.\n        4. Deletes data set by the original initializer, which is now garbage due to the shift in the storage layout.\n    2. Updates DISTRIBUTION_END to account for the delayed start to the Safety Module rewards.\n    3. Updates getRevision() to return a value of 2.\n\nThe on-chain proposal to be approved by governance will include the following transaction to be executed via the [Long Timelock](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters):\n\n\n\n* Call upgradeAndCall() on the Safety Module [Proxy Admin](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/dependencies/open-zeppelin/ProxyAdmin.sol) contract, to atomically perform the following:\n    1. Upgrade the Safety Module to use the new implementation contract.\n    2. Run the initializer function with the agreed amount and Recovery Contract address.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nDifferent approaches were considered as to how to handle the funds that had already been staked. The “clean slate” approach of resetting the Safety Module is recommended as we believe it is the simplest and safest solution from a technical perspective.\n\nDiscussion on the forums has so far centered around two main issues:\n\n\n\n* **The need for the Safety Module fix to be passed as soon as possible:** Reaching community consensus and implementing a quick solution will allow affected addresses to recover their funds, and allow everyone to access the Safety staking pool. The Safety Module adds an additional safeguard to the protocol. It should be noted that Safety Module contract upgrades must use the long timelock, which imposes a minimum 18 day period (~1 day voting delay, 10 days voting duration, and 7 day timelock) between when a proposal is created and when it takes effect. In addition, long timelock proposals require a minimum quorum of 100 million DYDX (10% of the total supply) in order to pass. This means any solution will require broad community support as well as governance participation from dYdX investor token holders. For these reasons, it is imperative that the community approve this DIP in its simplest form as soon as possible.\n* **The amount to offer affected addresses to make them whole:** Staked DYDX tokens have been locked in the smart contract since September 7, and remain locked until a fix is implemented by governance. Given that the Staking Module only processes withdrawals on an epoch basis (every 28 days), the staked tokens would have been locked at a minimum for the remainder of the epoch. The community generally agreed that it was reasonable to make stakers whole due to this error. Consensus evolved around the need to repay stakers for the amount they reasonably could have expected to earn by staking over an epoch, plus some damages. 10% of the amount staked for each affected address is a reasonable and simple policy.\n\n**Test Cases**\n\nThe Safety Module has a full suite of [unit tests](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/tree/master/test/safety-module) providing 100% code coverage. The proposed fix was simulated in both a local and forked mainnet environment. The test suite was then run, to ensure that full functionality will be restored, following the execution of the governance proposal on mainnet.\n\nIn addition to unit testing, thorough validation was performed on the mainnet state to ensure that we have a thorough and accurate understanding of both the current smart contract state on mainnet and the precise nature of the bug. This validation included checking all smart contract [state](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/test/safety-module/state.spec.ts) and [logs](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/test/safety-module/events.spec.ts), verification of the contract [bytecode](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/test/safety-module/bytecode.spec.ts), and detailed analysis of [storage slots](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/test/safety-module/storage-slots.spec.ts), including those that are not directly accessible by the contract. All test and deploy scripts are open-sourced in the dYdX Foundation [governance contracts](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts) repository.\n\n[Detailed instructions](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/safety/README.md) are provided on GitHub to allow anybody to run the same tests.\n\n**Implementation**\n\nA [full implementation](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/tree/master/contracts/safety/v2) is open-sourced in the dYdX Foundation governance contracts repository.\n\n**Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThe purpose of this DIP is to change the weight of the fee parameter from `a=0.67` to `a=0.8`, and decreasing the open interest parameter from `b=0.28` to `b=0.15` in the trader rewards formula, which we expect will lead to an increase in fees paid and a decrease in average open interest in each epoch. The dYdX Community voted and approved these changes via a Snapshot vote that concluded on April 23, 2022.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe dYdX Grants Program [funded](https://dydxgrants.com/funded-grants/approved-grants/rewards-optimization-research-and-paper) [Xenophon Labs](https://xenophonlabs.com/) to conduct [research](https://xenophonlabs.com/dydx_trade_rewards.pdf) into the dYdX trader rewards mechanism. In addition to demonstrating provably optimal rewards-maximizing trading strategies, we found that cumulative fees paid by the protocol are approximately linear in the fee weight parameter `a`. We also find that incentivizing open interest has not made a tangible impact on long-term protocol growth. Therefore, we propose an increase in the fee weight parameter `a` and a decrease in the open interest parameter `b`.\n\nWe submitted a snapshot vote on April 18 2022 to conclude on April 23 2022. The Snapshot vote concluded with 8.2M DYDX voting \"Yes\" and 1.7M DYDX voting \"NO\". The majority of the community (312 voters & 82.51%) supported to change the formula. This passes the quorum and consensus requirements for an off-chain proposal.\n\n## Motivation / Rationale\n\nOur research suggests that dYdX is leaving money on the table by giving open interest such a high weight in the trader rewards formula. This change is an effort to generate more revenue for the protocol. Specifically, we expect revenues to increase 20\\%, which at current prices would lead to an increase in trading fees paid of approximately \\$3M per epoch. For a more in-depth summary, see the post [here](https://forums.dydx.community/discussion/4190-discussion-dydx-trader-rewards-mechanism-review); for the research itself, see the research paper [here](https://xenophonlabs.com/dydx_trade_rewards.pdf).\n\n### Important Objections\n* Stakeholders who believe open interest parameter is more important than exchange revenues should vote `no` on this proposal.\n* Stakeholders who are currently maximizing their trader rewards will receive lower returns-per-fees-paid, however they will *also* not need to carry out as much open interest as before. How this affects their rewards-profit maximizing behavior is up to them to decide.\n\n\n## Specification\nAll relevant terms are defined in [dYdX's community documentation](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/rewards/trading-rewards#:~:text=DYDX%20will%20be%20distributed%20to,to%20any%20vesting%20or%20lockups.).\n\n\n## Implementation\n\n\ndYdX smart contracts do not directly control the trader rewards mechanism. If approved, the dYdX Foundation will request that dYdX Trading Inc. implement the changes in time for Epoch 10 (May 10, 2022).\n\nThis change should be rather simple to implement, and it is entirely off-chain.\n1. Increase the fee weight parameter `a` from `a=0.67` to `a=0.8`.\n2. Decrease the open interest weight parameter `b` from `b=0.28` to `b=0.15`.\n\n## Relevant Links\n* [Forum Discussion](https://forums.dydx.community/discussion/4190-discussion-dydx-trader-rewards-mechanism-review)\n* [Snapshot Vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0xce4b1334f337975a42c3f78dd16fb25e0b60e816a2d9382e402b5384bea37475)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThe purpose of this DIP is to implement maker volume into the calculation of liquidity provider rewards, as well as reduce the weight of depth, spread and stkDYDX. This should in theory provide a more equitable distribution of rewards and incentivize LP compeition, while creating a better trading environment for users.\n\n## Abstract\n\ndYdX’s liquidity provider reward program is dominated by two liquidity providers earning +90% of rewards every Epoch. While dYdX incentivizes for depth, spread, uptime and protocol alignment, market makers are not incentivized to compete for market share. This composition of market structure is detrimental to the longevity of dYdX as it produces a sub-optimal trading environment (large spreads) and discourages entrants (rewards are cornered due to size and stkDYDX). \n\nThe Snapshot vote concluded with 553 unique voters and a total of 18,263,364 DYDX voted. The overwhelming majority of the community (539 & 99.97% of DYDX) were in favor of moving forward with this proposal.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, dYdX rewards LPs for showing size and not their ability to compete for market share. This is done by:\n- Rewarding depth with increasing returns to scale, allowing LPs who have huge size sit passively in the orderbook and earn large amounts of rewards.\n- Largely reward stkDYDX with increasing returns to scale, allowing LPs with a big stkDYDX balance to compound their rewards as opposed to new entrants who need significant capital outlay to compete.\n\nThis deters new MM's from competiting as the current reward scheme is dominated by 2 LPs. This is not sustainable for one of the largest derivative protocols. Futhermore, by not incentivizing LPs to compete for market share there is less liquidity at the top of the order book which is not ideal for traders on the platform.\n\n## Specification\n\nProposed solution: \n1. Introduce maker volume into the calculation of LP rewards\n2. Reduce the weight of depth, spread and stkDYDX\n\nNew Liquidity Provider Reward Calculation:\nLet,\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105179217/167971038-8ead6700-61fd-410a-911c-6d256e7f8b2d.png)\n\nThe total rewards score for an individual LP, Qi, is then calculated as follows:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105179217/167971051-cec27e63-dac0-45bc-8195-a8fbd08ed87a.png)\n\nNote:\nIn the original formula stkDYDX is defined as:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105179217/167971084-261f87b5-6c5b-4453-9fc2-ffc0be53cc68.png)\n\nrepresenting an LP’s average stkDYDX score as a proportion of the total pool of stkDYDX. However, given that “Total Pool stkDYDX” is constant across all LPs it simply scales each LP’s score. Therefore,\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105179217/167971099-78235ec4-0f0d-481b-bf29-d617ced539dc.png)\n\nis equivalent. This is true for uptime and maker volume as well.\n\nConstant Returns to Scale:\nThe new weightings are constructed to have constant returns to scale i.e.,\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105179217/167971164-c5b650e7-e251-4f4e-97c6-2648f1193b8a.png)\n\nThis ensures that if an LP were to split their activity in half across two addresses, they would receive half of their share of rewards in each address and therefore, the same total amount of rewards. Originally, d = 1, v = 0, and s =0.5 producing increasing returns to scale. This advantages large players and incentives combining activity in a single address. For example, doubling the depth posted and stkDYDX results in more than twice the reward share currently.\n\n## Rationale\n\nIntroducing maker volume rewards active liquidity, pushing current liquidity closer to ‘desired’ liquidity by inviting competition towards the top of the order book. Naturally, spreads become tighter as LPs fight for market share, traders receive a better trading environment, and active LPs are rewarded for facilitating flow. Weighting maker volume with the highest exponent of v = 0.45 (except uptime), should incentivize such behavior. However, when combined with a reduction in the weight of depth and spread, there is a possibility that deep/passive liquidity is overpenalized.\n\nWithout reducing the weight of depth and spread, I expect LPs with large size to continue sitting deep in the order book unless disincentivized. Reducing the exponent of Di from d = 1 to d = 0.35, forces LPs to re-optimize their strategy from passive to active as incentives get cut, once again inviting a better trading experience for users and a more equitable reward scheme amongst a variety of LPs. One concern with the aforementioned changes is the possibility of overpenalizing depth and the quality of liquidity, discouraging large traders from using dYdX. Our goal is to not strictly eliminate depth, but instead taper how much dYdX is paying for such liquidity.\n\nThe final reduction in weighting is for the stkDYDX term, from s = 0.5 to s = 0.2. Currently, stkDYDX plays a notable role in LPs receiving rewards. While a large stkDYDX balance is not necessary to achieve a substantial amount of rewards (i.e. new kid on the block), LPs with large amounts of stDYDX can afford to be ‘lazy’ and/or dominate reward share. This leads to incumbents having a major competitive advantage over entrants, and misalignment with current and desired liquidity. As early supporters, Wintermute has chosen to stake a large majority of our rewards and thus have a large stkDYDX balance. While rewarding early supporters is important and having stkDYDX in the LP calculation is beneficial for LP-protocol alignment, I think reducing the dependency on stkDYDX will allow for a more equitable distribution of rewards and increase LP participation.\n\nAlternative Weighting:\nThe proposed weights were chosen based on how desired liquidity could be achieved without overpenalizing depth, favoring an LPs ability to compete for market share as opposed to showing size. However, it’s important to consider alternative weighting:\n\nScenario 1:\nEqually weight maker volume and depth/spread:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105179217/167971277-f6b13812-3668-4a5a-acd6-a374b6783e40.png)\n\nScenario 2:\nEqual Weights w/ Reduce weight of stkDYDX (i.e., LP - Protocol Alignment):\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105179217/167971287-e15f7680-932d-4221-85f0-972967ec2d68.png)\n\nScenario 3:\nHeavily Favor Maker Volume:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105179217/167971296-bfb30a6e-5aaa-446b-bc1f-673d601ac2e9.png)\n\nScenario 4:\nHeavily Favor Depth/Spread:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105179217/167971306-b70f982d-70c7-4536-8a6a-b1d17e555685.png)\n\nGeneral Consensus:\nThe very large majority of the community were in favour of introducing maker volume and reducing the weights of stkDYDX, depth and spread. There 2 prominent arguments were the constructs of the weights: v = 0.45, d = 0.35, s = 0.2 vs. v = 0.7, d = 0.2, s = 0.1. However, the weights introduced in this proposal were seen as more appropriate given the significant change this proposal introduces in general. Futhermore, this proposal is intended to limit the amount of rewards spent on depth without trying to completely eliminate it.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

Data shows the USDC staked in the Pool is underutilized, resulting in the Community inefficiently rewarding stakers with DYDX for their staked USDC.\n\nWe expect to see a revamp of liquidity programs through new initiatives outside of the Liquidity Staking Pool.\n\nEach epoch, the 383,562 DYDX currently allocated to USDC stakers will instead accummulate in the Rewards Treasury. The dYdX community may redirect the DYDX from the Rewards Treasury with a vote falling under the requierement of the short timelock. Also, an additional proposal can be submitted to transfer the DYDX back to the Community Treasury if needed.\n\nThe snapshot vote concluded with 632 voters and 17M DYDX in agreement (99.96%).

As a result, 383, 562 DYDX are distributed pro-rata to stakers each epoch. While this had some success initially, the program is no longer an efficient allocation of DYDX for the following reasons:\n\n**1. Underutilization**\n\nThe dYdX community is currently rewarding USDC stakers with 383, 562 DYDX each epoch. Assuming DYDX is priced at $2.00, this amounts to over $767K in DYDX. Given that $193M USDC is currently unborrowed (~70%), the dYdX community is paying DYDX rewards for underutilized USDC capital.\n\n**2. Inadequate Disclosure**\n\nMost prospective borrowers have not fulfilled the disclosure requirements that the Community voted to adopt in the borrowing framework.\n\n**3. Impact on Market Structure**\n\nIn Epoch 9, the dYdX community almost unanimously supported updating the LP rewards formula to redistribute LP rewards in a more equitable manner to incentivize competition. Currently, the structure of the borrowing pool negatively impacts competition among LPs.\n\nInstead, re-allocating the remaining rewards back to the Community Treasury will allow the DAO to scale and initiate different growth programs. In addition to this, we anticipate new liquidity programs to be launched after the winding down of this Pool.\n\n## Specification\n\nUnder the implementation, DYDX will accrue in the [Rewards Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x639192D54431F8c816368D3FB4107Bc168d0E871) each epoch. The dYdX community will have control over accrued DYDX that previously would have been distributed to stakers in the liquidity module. With a governance vote DYDX held in the Rewards Treasury can be (1) sent to the Community Treasury or (2) sent directly to an Ethereum address for any Community directed purpose.\n\nThe following code changes will be approved in relation to this proposal:\n- Setting the liquidity staking pool rewards per second to 0.\n- Decreasing the length of the blackout window to three days.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe Community had expressed overwhelming support for the winding down of the Liquidity Staking Pool in discussions. We believe this to be in the best interest of the Community and protocol.\n\n## Implementation\n\nA full implementation is open-sourced on the dYdX Foundation Github: https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/pull/33\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

Each Epoch 2,876,712 will be distributed as trading rewards and the remaining 958,904 DYDX (“Excess DYDX”) that were previously allocated for distribution will accrue in the Rewards Treasury. The Excess DYDX (958,904 DYDX per epoch) that accrues in the Rewards Treasury can be used/directed by the dYdX community with a governance vote ([Short Timelock](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters))\n\n## Abstract\n\ndYdX trading rewards are the largest form of reward emissions across the platform by a significant margin, emitting 3,835,616 DYDX per epoch or roughly 50m DYDX a year. \n\nOn July 31, the Snapshot vote to reduce trading rewards by 25% concluded with the majority (22.8M DYDX (99.13%) from 532 voters) of the dYdX community that voted in support of the reduction. This proposal seeks to ratify a 25% reduction in trading rewards.\n\nRelevant Links:\n* Snapshot:\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x28193f3cc8f0a1d1a98a7c32ea4cd51b497c27b8de6bdb36208c4fd4883a0c73\n* Community Discussion:\nhttps://forums.dydx.community/discussion/6324-discussion-revisionssimplification-of-trading-rewards\n* Trading Rewards:\nhttps://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/rewards/trading-rewards\n* Rewards Treasury: https://etherscan.io/address/0x639192D54431F8c816368D3FB4107Bc168d0E871\n* Pull Request with the Proposed Update:\nhttps://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/pull/34\n\n## Motivation\n  \nIn light of ongoing depressed market conditions, the current trading reward emission schedule seems excessively high relative to the growth in platform activity. When thinking about the long-term success of dYdX and its transition to v4, it makes sense to eliminate areas of overspending in the protocol to ensure future opportunities or needs can be met. This proposal requests to reduce trading rewards by 25% every epoch for the foreseeable future, eliminating the overspending of DYDX and preserving funds for future expenditure.\n\n## Specification\nProposal Changes:\n * Reduce per-epoch trading reward emissions from 3,835,616 DYDX to 2,876,712 DYDX (Excess DYDX: 958,904)\n\nNote: Excess DYDX will accrue in the Rewards Treasury, but can be moved via an on-chain community vote\n  \n*Smart Contract Implementations:*\n* Updates setRewardsParameters for trader rewards in the Merkle Distributor to 2,876,712 per epoch\n\nThe on-chain proposal to be approved by governance will include the following transaction to be executed via the [Short Timelock](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters):\n* Update the Merkle Distributor to the new trading rewards parameters\n\n## Rationale\nThe community was largely in agreement with the reduction in trading rewards as evident by forum discussion and the passing of a snapshot vote. While there were discussions about the magnitude of reduction in trading rewards, starting with 25% was agreed upon as a reasonable start to limiting emissions and assessing the effects on trading activity.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nA full test case is provided in the implementation found [here](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/486e3f4966c4f8763ce4e4e301074fa0cd18649c/test/misc/update-merkle-distributor-rewards-parameters.spec.ts).\n\n## Implementation\n\nA [full implementation](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/pull/34) is open-sourced in the dYdX Foundation governance contracts repository.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

This spending is meant to provide insurance power for the protocol in the case of a shortfall event. However, our research suggests that the SSM is not an effective insurance fund, due to the practical difficulty of slashing the SSM, as well as the much lower value that the DYDX token would be sellable for in the case of a shortfall event, due to market contagion and lack of liquidity. While in the long term we believe the SSM should be replaced by a module with better insurance power, such as a USDC Safety Staking Module or a USDC-DYDX Balancer LP token Safety Staking Module, this would require too much of a lift for the dYdX team currently. Thus, we believe it is appropriate to halt emissions to the current SSM until we can replace it following the launch of dYdX V4.\n\n## Specification\n\nUnder the implementation, DYDX will accrue in the [Rewards Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x639192D54431F8c816368D3FB4107Bc168d0E871) each epoch.

Three Trustees and an Enforcer will be appointed to manage the responsibilities of the Trust.\n\nTo cover compensation and expenses, we are requesting a total of $360,000 in DYDX to be transferred from the Community Treasury to the Ops Trust multisig.\nThe Operations subDAO will be operational for an initial 6 month period to deliver the responsibilites outlined below.\n\nThe snapshot vote concluded with 783 voters and 7.7M DYDX in agreement (75.43%). The vote results have shown significant support for the program.\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0xa710b0ca85e04ac2db123ae522ac5030a008ccbc8d4d413e83d18f6032b39758\n\n**Relevant Links**\n\nDRC discussion: https://commonwealth.im/dydx/discussion/7620-drc-dydx-operations-trust\n\n## Motivation\n\ndYdX is facing an important decision to scale the protocol thoughtfully as it transitions to full community control. As a community, we have to look ahead towards organizational transformation through the use of subDAOs. Accomplishing this goal will first require guidance on structural implementation.\n\nSpeaking from experience with the Grants Trust, launching a subDAO is not quite as simple as opening a wallet and getting community funding. There are tons of legal procedures, operational headaches, and other nuances to building a truly internet-native organization. Community members should be able to benefit from the know-how and experience gained through the process that led to the creation and operation of the Grants Trust.\n\nTo keep up with the competitive landscape, the DAO will also need to operate quickly. Doing so will require a standardized process for launching new subDAOs in charge of important functions. The playbook to be written by the Ops Trust will give the community a thoughtful approach for quickly spinning up new subDAOs, including all legal and operational procedures necessary.\n\n## Specification\n\n**Trust Agreement**\nIf this proposal is passed, the Trust will be formed with dYdX Consent as defined in the Trust Agreement. The full agreement can be seen here:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/16ubaQpxlnmybYkoSE5ML_NkgR36EyrH0/view?usp=sharing\n\n**The subDAO will be funded for a period of 6 months**\n\nReverie will work with outside legal counsel to establish a Guernsey Purpose Trust. The Trust will be formed with the following contributors:\n\n**Trustees**\n- Reverie Reserves, LLC\n- Joanna Pope\n- Callen Van Den Elst\n\n**Enforcer**\nGeorge Beall\n\n**Responsibilities**\n- Open a fiat bank account for the Ops Trust\n- Hire and manage external legal staff for ongoing guidance\n- Payments and Financial Reporting\n- Create communication channels for the Ops Trust, as needed, which can serve as the standard dYdX DAO’s communication channel going forward\n- Build and share a DAO playbook for launching new dYdX subDAOs\n\n**Compensation and Expenses**\n- Reverie will receive **$15,000 per month** and a **$90,000 success fee** for publishing the DAO playbook\n- Joanna Pope will receive **$1,500 per month** as Trustee\n- Callen Van Den Else has waived compensation as Trustee\n- George Beall will receive **$2,000 per month** as Enforcer\n\nWe are requesting an additional **$100,000** to cover legal and operational expenses for all Ops Trust related engagements.\n\nIn total, $360,000 will be used to fund the initial 6 month operation of the Ops subDAO.\n\n\n**DYDX Amount**\n\nThe amount of DYDX to be moved from the community treasury to the Ops Trust Multisig will be determined using a 24h vwap of the trades executed on the most liquid exchange, namely Binance.com. The previous day's trades will be used to capture a full 24h window so as to avoid timing constraints. The following data file is used: https://data.binance.vision/data/spot/daily/trades/DYDXUSDT/DYDXUSDT-trades-2022-12-10.zip\n\nThis formula will be used to calculate the price: Σ(Price * Volume) / Σ(Volume).\n\nFrom the data, we find: $6,370,831.51 / 3,967,848 = $1.606.\n\nThe DYDX Amount to be transferred will be $360,000 / $1.606 = **225,000.00 DYDX** (rounded up to the nearest thousand for simplicity).\n\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe community has addressed certain concerns and issues with a dYdX Operations subDAO run by Reverie in the DRC, namely regarding possible conflicts with the existing involvement in the Grants program. Since the responsibilities of this Trust do not overlap with our responsibilities as Grants lead and Enforcer on the dYdX Grants Trust, we believe there is no conflict in our role as Trustee for the Ops Trust. Beyond these initial concerns, overall consensus has been in strong support of launching as indicated through the Snapshot vote and general positive feedback. The dYdX Ops subDAO will act as a catalyst for the growth of the dYdX DAO through the launching of new subDAOs.\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nRemove `stkDYDX` from the LP rewards mechanism, and reallocate the `stkDYDX` term's weight to `MakerVolume`.\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe propose removing the `stkDYDX` term from the LP rewards mechanism and reallocating the `stkDYDX` term's weight to `MakerVolume`. The decision to remove the `stkDYDX` term follows naturally from the community's decision to wind down the safety staking module. The decision to reallocate the `stkDYDX` term's weight to the `MakerVolume` term comes from our opinion that volume is the best proxy for value that LPs provide to the protocol's traders.\n\nOn December 10, 2022, there was a Snapshot vote on this which concluded with 883 voters and 16,177,534 DYDX in agreement (99.97%) to make these LP rewards formula changes.\n\n**Relevant Links**\n* [DRC discussion](https://forums.dydx.community/discussion/7872-drc-remove-stkdydx-from-lp-rewards-formulas)\n* [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0xa81ef2ab284b27338fcb96da592d2b1900fc121eccc445e52597c9208491afa1)\n\n## Motivation\nSince the safety staking module is being wound down, incentivizing `stkDYDX` no longer makes sense. As for giving more weight to the volume term, this is because we believe volume is the most direct way of incentivizing LPs to provide better-utilizedliquidity to traders of the protocol.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWeights for non BTC/ETH markets to `v = 0.65, d = 0.35, and s = 0.00`. In effect, remove the `stkDYDX` (`s`) term entirely and give its previous weight to the volume (`v`) term.\n\nWeights for BTC and ETH markets to `v= 0.85, d = 0.15, s = 0.00`. In effect, remove the `stkDYDX` (`s`) term entirely and give its previous weight to the volume (`v`) term.\n\nUpdates to the LP rewards formula and rewards allocation do not require any smart contract changes. Revisions to the LP rewards formula and rewards allocation will be implemented by dYdX Trading after the start of Epoch 18 (December 20, 2022, at 3 PM UTC). Epoch 18's rewards will be calculated using the new weights.\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to reduce trading rewards to 1,582,192 DYDX from 2,876,712 DYDX. The excess 1,294,520 DYDX will accrue in the Rewards Treasury and can be used/directed by the dYdX community with a governance vote ([Short Timelock](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters)).\n\n## Abstract\n\nAs part of our [V4 Vanguard Post](https://forums.dydx.community/discussion/9916-v4-vanguard), we propose to reduce Trading Rewards by ~45%. In the current market downturn, we believe Trading Rewards remain excessive and are the highest contributor to yearly token inflation.\n\nOn Feb 15th, 2023, there was a Snapshot vote to gauge the community’s sentiment towards such a change. The vote passed with 27,534,218 DYDX in favour (91.60% of votes) from 776 voters.\n\n### Relevant Links\n- [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0xf6560afee2b771db087a9bf67abb1aa98023cabff066c0e7033fb83d2980179c)\n- [Forum Discussion](https://forums.dydx.community/discussion/9949-drc-reduce-trading-rewards-by-45)\n\n## Motivation\nBy reducing trading rewards, excess DYDX are retained in the rewards/community treasury. This can be accessed by the community through a governance vote, but most importantly, the retained DYDX will have a significant impact on the DAOs ability to fund initiatives in V4 in a sustainable and controlled manner!\n\n## Specification\n\n### Proposed Changes:\n- Reduce per-epoch trading reward emissions to 1,582,192 DYDX from 2,876,712 DYDX (Excess DYDX: 1,294,520)\nNote: Excess DYDX will accrue in the Rewards Treasury, but can be moved via an on-chain community vote.\n\n### Smart Contract Implementations:\nUpdates setRewardsParameters for trader rewards in the Merkle Distributor to 1,582,192 per epoch\nThe on-chain proposal to be approved by governance will include the following transaction to be executed via the [Short Timelock](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters):\n- Update the Merkle Distributor to the new trading rewards parameter.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe magnitude of the cut to Trading Rewards was driven by the disproportionate allocation towards DYDX Trading Rewards in comparison to Liquidity Provider Rewards and the Community/Rewards Treasury. Furthermore, the change aligns with a new distribution and emission schedule outlined in V4 Vanguard. There were community members not in favour of the reduction, however, given the current market conditions the majority of the community was in favour of this proposal as indicated in the Snapshot.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nA full test case is provided in the implementation found [here.](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/f82ae1165d428b282da57831408da4520bd8570e/test/misc/update-merkle-distributor-rewards-parameters-v2.spec.ts)\n\n## Implementation\n\nA full implementation of the proposed change can be found [here.](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/pull/39/commits/f82ae1165d428b282da57831408da4520bd8570e#diff-7eb7d483f4a795b587ba7224faf58d79f0ffa5e2ef1924534d50c2c740e733ba)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

Without an active community underlying the protocol, efforts for effective and progressive decentralisation could well and truly fall mute. The purpose of the DIP was to provide the community with better and adequate tools (in this case a forum) to discuss, debate and propose changes to the dYdX Ecosystem. It is my belief that this change alone could bring an increase in participation at the forum-stage however, more has to be done to funnel further users and incenivise thought-sharing and diplomatic debate in an ever-increasing manner. This is just the first step underatken in an effort to increase dYdX Community participation and progressively decentralise. \n## Specification\n\nThe technical specifications relate to the transition to a new forum platform (Discourse). Discourse has now been launched and can be found at ['dydx.forum'](https://dydx.forum/).\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe Community has long been addressing its frustrations with the Commonwealth platform. These concerns were addressed numerous times but the necessary changes were not implemented. Thus, a transition to Discourse was suggested so as to optimise this stage of the governance process.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

Due to efficiencies on testing and deployment with recommendation from the Starkware team, the changes from these 2 separate proposals are bundled into one single on-chain DIP for implementation.\n\n## Abstract\n\n### Increase the maximum 8h funding rate from 0.75% to 4% across all markets\nConsidered Finance, through a research grant from the DGP, published a paper on the implications of the existing funding rate bounds on dYdX markets. The research identified several occasions where the maximum rates have been insufficient to incentivize convergence between dYdX market prices and underlying index prices. This causes inefficiencies in dYdX markets and trading experiences. To solve this problem, Considered Finance proposes increasing the maximum 8h rates to a bound between -4% and 4%, up from -0.75% and 0.75%. This change will improve the trading experience and reduce the need for manual interventions through margin adjustments.\n\nThe snapshot [vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0xfabe06f07828bf6d38110a17cb189ccd3e7b2f97d120023c7723f8893c89214d) concluded with 657 voters and 18M DYDX in agreement (99.99%). The vote results have shown significant support for the proposal.\n\n\n### Modify the V3 Perpetual smart-contracts to fix DA issue\nA bug has been identified in the current version of the dYdX StarkEx Cairo code, which is only triggered for the specific case of a Trade resulting in the collateral balance (i.e. value) equaling exactly zero (after all fees are paid) and for an account that still has positions open. In this case, instead of sending the correct funding timestamp for the position, a zero value is sent on-chain, thus, the timestamp won’t be converted into the actual funding indices which constitute the state. This may result in the inability to retrieve funds once the exchange is frozen (doomsday scenario) and both dYdX and StarkWare are unable to provide assistance to users (become malicious or maliciously hacked).\n\nStarkware has prepared a fix to the relevant Cairo code to prevent this, and confirmed that other operational change from Starkware or dYdX Trading is minimal around the issue; the on-chain data does not have to change except in this rare-case scenario.\n\nThe snapshot [vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x31f58b0bef1cbc336fd0f65a52e8add8943e1448afe7fc32da85744501020148) concluded with 889 voters and 21M DYDX in agreement (100%). The vote results have shown significant support for the proposal.\n\n### Relevant Links\n#### Increase the maximum 8h funding rate from 0.75% to 4% across all markets\n- [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0xfabe06f07828bf6d38110a17cb189ccd3e7b2f97d120023c7723f8893c89214d)\n- [Forum Discussion](https://commonwealth.im/dydx/discussion/10234-drc-increase-the-maximum-funding-rate)\n- [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SyZJPmJXhyjapY_Dr9gJjU_gJLAwwWgf/view)\n\n#### Modify the V3 Perpetual smart-contracts to fix DA issue\n- [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x31f58b0bef1cbc336fd0f65a52e8add8943e1448afe7fc32da85744501020148)\n- [Forum Discussion](https://commonwealth.im/dydx/discussion/10634-v3-starkware-contract-data-availability-bug)\n\n## Motivation\n### Increase the maximum 8h funding rate from 0.75% to 4% across all markets\nIncreasing the maximum funding rate bounds reduces the need for manual intervention on markets, for example increasing the initial margin fractions and imposing Close-Only modes. These interventions hamper user experiences for traders. Further, increasing the bound reduces the likelihood of dislocation between dYdX market prices and the underlying index prices, improving the health of dYdX markets.\n\n### Modify the V3 Perpetual smart-contracts to fix DA issue\nDeploying this fix will ensure that there are no dependencies on both dYdX Trading and StarkWare to allow users to reconstruct the entire Position Merkle Tree holding the positions. In particular, this allows them to trustless-ly escape the dYdX exchange in case it becomes frozen (e.g. due to the inability of the exchange to operate or as a result of censorship of forced transactions).\n\n## Specification\n\n### Increase the maximum 8h funding rate from 0.75% to 4% across all markets\n**Proposed Changes:**\n\nIncrease the max_funding_rate parameter from 0.75% to 4% to be implemented across all dYdX perpetual markets.\n\nThe following code change will be approved as part of this proposal:\n- Change the max_funding_rate variable found in the dydx production_general_config of the starkware contract from '1120' to '5970'. \n- 5970 is determined using 0.04 * 2 ^ 32 / (60 * 60 * 8)\n\n### Modify the V3 Perpetual smart-contracts to fix DA issue\n**Proposed Changes:**\n\n- Starkware will first deploy a new FinalizableGpsFactAdapter contract with the new programHash variable which is a hash of the Cairo code. The existing version of the contract can be found here.\n\n\n- The V3 Perpetual smart-contracts will be modified to “point” to this new contract. The data of the governance vote would involve sending two transactions:\n  - add_implementation to add the already-deployed contracts with the new_adapter on top. \n  - upgrade_to transaction with the same data as the add_implementation.\n\nThese change will be executed through a Starkware Priority Timelock Executor [proposal](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/resources/technical-overview).\n\n### Summary of specification\nThe DIP [ref7] contains the transactions needed to be submitted by the PriorityExecutor [ref5] onto the dydx smart contract [ref6].\nThe transaction set includes six transactions: three for the max funding rate change, and three for the change of the Cairo program hash required for the on-chain DA bug fix.\n1. Transaction 0-2 (max funding rate fix):\n    - Tx 0 PriorityExecutor accepts governance (main governance) which is required to perform config hash change.\n    - Tx 1 register new config hash.\n    - Tx 2 apply the new config hash.\n\n2. Transaction 3-5 (DA bug fix):\n    - Tx 3 PriorityExecutor accepts governance (proxy governance) which is required to perform upgrades.\n    - Tx 4 addImplementation - The update of the Cairo program hash is performed in a manner of an upgrade, which effectively only replaces the       FinalizableGpsFactAdapter with the new one[4] bearing the new hash.\n    - Tx 5 upgradeTo - applying the upgrade cycle submitted in Tx 4.\n\n### References and Implementation:\n1.

A fork test was performed to attest the change in value for this function after successful proposal execution.\n- The on-chain data fix is quite small and the code is published so the diff is fully visible (see reference 3 above). The code was validated with unit tests as well as system tests and has been successfully deployed on the Goerli system on which dYdX perform their testing.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe community has expressed strong support for the proposal in both the DRC and snapshot voting stages. The implementation of the proposal will result in an improvement to the health of dYdX markets and user experiences for active traders.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nImportant Notice: This proposal is being sponsored by Wintermute Governance’s DYDX proposal/voting power on behalf of the dYdX Operations Trust.\n\nOn behalf of the dYdX Operations Trust (“DOT”), Trustees Joanna and Callen are requesting $6.6M of funding from the [dYdX community treasury](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/start-here/community-treasury) to be transferred to the DOT’s [multi-sig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa8541f948411b3F95d9e89e8D339a56A9ed3D00b) to fund operations of the Operations subDAO for an additional 18-month term (“DOT 2.0”).\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe dYdX Operations SubDAO is creating this DIP on behalf of the DOT to request $6.6M in funding for the next 18 months.\n\nFrom our perspective, it is critical for the dYdX DAO, and specifically the OPS subDAO, to take steps before the potential launch of dYdX V4 on mainnet to ensure that the dYdX DAO has the resources, tools, and infrastructure it needs to lead a fully decentralized version of the dYdX protocol. \n\nThe funding request will cover the operations and administrative needs of the dYdX Operations subDAO as described in the proposal for 18 months.\n\nThe DOT currently has $87,077.50 USDC remaining. After the expiration of the DOT 1.0 term on June 19, 2023, we are proposing to roll over any remaining budget to DOT 2.0.\n\nThe [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x51659bfec4948e80c0b85316d3098e62ab085a95033f1c0fe6bcc72db3ebe814) concluded with 303 voters and 17.7M DYDX in agreement (99.95%). The vote results have shown significant support for the next phase of DOT.\n\nRelevant Links:\n[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x51659bfec4948e80c0b85316d3098e62ab085a95033f1c0fe6bcc72db3ebe814)\n[Forum Discussion](https://dydx.forum/t/dydx-operations-subdao-v2/274)\n\n## Motivation\n\nOn 15 May 2023, the dYdX Foundation posted, [“Exploring the dYdX Operations subDAO’s near future”](https://dydx.foundation/blog/exploring-the-dydx-operations-subdaos-near-future). We agree that the dYdX ecosystem is approaching a critical juncture with the potential launch of dYdX V4 mainnet and the initial 6-month term of the DOT expiring on June 19, 2023. \n\nTo ensure that the dYdX DAO has the resources, tools, and infrastructure it needs to lead a fully decentralized version of the dYdX protocol DOT 2.0 will be responsible for:\n\nRecruiting an [Operations Lead](https://apply.workable.com/dydx-operations-trust/j/2C4716A228/), a [Technical Project Lead](https://apply.workable.com/dydx-operations-trust/j/A62FE0DD9F/), and a [Site Reliability Engineer](https://apply.workable.com/dydx-operations-trust/j/D5F3924650/) to scale the Ops subDAO and to provide technical support to prepare the dYdX DAO for the future.\nIdentifying an indexer operator and contribute to deploying an indexer in the potential future version of the dYdX protocol.\nContribute to deploying open-source software and the running of a version of the iOS app, Android app, and website (browser) front-ends for the potential future version of the dYdX protocol.\nEngage a third-party auditor to assess DOT’s finances and performance, as well as increase the number of trustees on DOT’s multisig.\nThe remaining funds at the end of the DOT 2.0 mandate will be sent to a community-controlled wallet at the discretion of the dYdX community.\n\nFor a full breakdown of the proposal’s mandate please see the [forum post](https://dydx.forum/t/dydx-operations-subdao-v2/274).\n\n## Specification\n\n### Funding:\n\nTo run the DOT for the next 18 months, we are requesting $6,600,000 from the dYdX Community Treasury to cover costs and contributor compensation.\n\nProposed Budget:\n\n| Category                   |                                                                                                                      Specifics                                                                                                                     | Total Funding (18 Months) |                                                                   Rationale                                                                   |\n|----------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n| **Contributor compensation**   | Operations Lead<br>- $100-130,000 USDC / year                                                                                                                                                                                                      | $195,000                  | [Hedgey - DAO compensation](https://hedgey.mirror.xyz/5p1brRD9_JRLheP0hn1BI99w1hl2puSOgKm8-zxCtLA)<br><br> [Maker SES](https://expenses.makerdao.network/core-unit/SES/finances/reports)<br><br>[How much does it really cost to run a DAO?

The previous day's trades will be used to capture a full 24h window so as to avoid timing constraints. The following data file is used:\n\nhttps://data.binance.vision/data/spot/daily/trades/DYDXUSDT/DYDXUSDT-trades-2023-06-12.zip\n\nThis formula will be used to calculate the price: Σ(Price * Volume) / Σ(Volume).\n\nFrom the data, we calculate the 24h VWAP price to be: $9,014,897 / $5,881,461  = $1.53\n\n\nThe DYDX Amount to be transferred will be $6,600,000 / $1.53 = 4,314,000 DYDX (rounded up to the nearest thousand for simplicity).\n\n\n### Trustees:\nReverie Reserves, LLC, and George Beall have decided that they will no longer be involved in the DOT as a trustee and the enforcer, respectively, after the expiration of the current term on June 19, 2023. We also recognize that as funding increases, adding additional security measures becomes increasingly important. As such, we have decided to increase the number of trustees to 5 and upgrade the multi-sig to 3-of-5 from a 2-of-3.\n\nIf this on-chain vote is passed, the dYdX Operations Trust by the consent of the dYdX community will be amended to reflect the new Trustees and Enforcer listed below:\n\nTrustees:\n* Joanna Pope Consulting Pty Ltd\n* Callen Van Den Elst\n* Chaos Labs, Ltd\n* Flipside Cayman, Ltd\n* Christoph Sonn\n\nEnforcer:\n* Joseph Axisa\n\nNote: Francis Gowen (Fig) will join the Trust as Flipside Cayman, Ltd, and Joanna Pope will join the Trust as Joanna Pope Consulting Pty Ltd. This is slightly different to the structure outlined in the [forum post](https://dydx.forum/t/dydx-operations-subdao-v2/274/23) \n\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe outlined budget and subsequent mandate have been designed to address the critical needs of the DAO moving into the potential launch of V4. Specifically addressing items that are critical to providing the resources, tools, and infrastructure the DAO needs to lead a fully decentralized version of the dYdX protocol.\n\nGiven the large funding request, we have decided to increase the multi-sig to a 3-of-5 from a 2-of-3. This will improve security and bring greater peace of mind and transparency to the community.\n\nOverall, the community has been very supportive of this proposal indicated in both the [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x51659bfec4948e80c0b85316d3098e62ab085a95033f1c0fe6bcc72db3ebe814) and [forum discussion](https://dydx.forum/t/dydx-operations-subdao-v2/274)\n\n\n## Voting Options:\n\nYes:\n* Transfer $6.6M of DYDX from the [Community Treasury](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/start-here/community-treasury) to the DOT multisig (0xa8541f948411b3F95d9e89e8D339a56A9ed3D00b).\n* Remove Reverie Reserves, LLC, and George Beall as a trustee and the enforcer, respectively, at the end of the DOT 1.0 term on June 19th.\n* Appoint Chaos Labs, Ltd, Flipside Cayman, Ltd, and Christoph Sonn as the 3 new Trustees and Joseph Axisa as the new Enforcer to the dYdX Operations Trust.\n* Reflect the Trustee amendment for Joanna Pope to continue being a Trustee under Joanna Pope Consulting Pty Ltd.\n* Amend and restate the trust instrument, as necessary, to reflect the DOT 2.0 mandate.\n\nNo:\n* Reject this proposal.\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\nThis proposal seeks to reduce liquidity provider rewards to 575,343 DYDX per epoch from 1,150,685 DYDX per epoch. The excess 575,342 DYDX per epoch will accrue in the Rewards Treasury and can be used/directed by the dYdX community with a governance vote ([Short Timelock](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters)).\n\n## Abstract\nWe propose to reduce LP rewards to 575,343 DYDX per epoch, along with recommending to dYdX Trading Inc. that they set the maker rebate to 0.85 bps. We believe that these changes will promote more active liquidity near the top of the orderbook, which will be beneficial to the vast majority of traders on the exchange. Of course, this will also benefit token holders, 575, 342 additional DYDX will accrue in the Rewards Treasury each epoch and can be used by the dYdX community with a governance vote.\n\nOn July 18, there was a Snapshot vote to gauge the community’s sentiment towards such a change. The vote passed with 25,482,204.81 DYDX in favor (99.96% of votes) and 9,015.7 DYDX in opposition.\n\n## Relevant Links\n* [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x0ea7f312f0970e0a9e4e34bd38af59dd79babcd11169282971df1fc210228359)\n* [Forum Discussion](https://dydx.forum/t/drc-shifting-from-lp-rewards-toward-market-maker-rebates/594)\n\n## Motivation\nThe motivation for this proposal has two components: DAO cost savings and improved exchange liquidity. This proposal would increase the DYDX funds controlled by token holders, which would in turn enable the DAO to fund key initiatives. Furthermore, if dYdX Trading Inc. implements the recommended increase in maker rebates, we anticipate that there will be even more liquidity closer to the top of the order book. Given that historically, most volume eats through less than 1bp of liquidity, the increase in top-of-orderbook liquidity should benefit the majority of taker volume.\n\n## Specification\n### Proposed Changes\nReduce the LP rewards by 50% from 1,150,685 DYDX/epoch to 575,343 DYDX/epoch. The 575,342 DYDX/epoch that are not distributed to LPs will vest to the rewards treasury, which can be redirected by a DAO vote.\n\n## Implementation\n[Updates setRewardsParameters](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/9514fd8c2b7f874c395754f887e4f7026725e7b5/src/migrations/update-merkle-distributor-rewards-parameters-dip24.ts) for LP rewards in the Merkle Distributor to 575,343 DYDX per epoch. The on-chain proposal to be voted on by governance will include the following transaction to be executed via the [Short Timelock](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters):\n\n* Update the Merkle Distributor to the new liquidity provider rewards parameter.\n\n## Test Cases\nA full test case is provided in the implementation found [here](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/9514fd8c2b7f874c395754f887e4f7026725e7b5/test/misc/update-merkle-distributor-rewards-parameters-dip24.spec.ts#L33).\n\n## Implementation\nA full implementation of the proposed changes can be found [here](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/pull/46).\n\n**Timing of Implementation**\n- Epoch 25 ends on August 1, 2023, at 15:00 UTC.\n- 1,150,685 DYDX will be distributed under LP rewards in Epoch 25 (the current epoch).\n- If the proposal is successfully executed, the reduction of LP rewards will take effect immediately in Epoch 26. As a result, 575,343 DYDX will be distributed to LPs according to the LP rewards formulas in Epoch 26.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n",

As part of the extension, replace four of the five Trustees and the Enforcer of the dYdX Grants Trust.\n\n## Abstract\n\nReverie is proposing to extend the current version of the dYdX Grants Program (v1.5) for an additional six months.\nThe extension will leverage the knowledge and experience from the previous rounds to continue funding high impact projects that drive protocol growth throughout the transition to dYdX v4.\nTo improve the management and efficiency of the program, the organizational structure will be updated to include more contributors. The concept of _funding buckets_ is introduced to split grants between Community Initiatives and Strategic Initiatives, with different Grantors responsible for each bucket. Additionally, an Operator role is added to manage the financial activity and reporting of the program.\nThe extension also includes updating the dYdX Grants Trust with four new Trustees and a new Enforcer. The updates to the Trust ensure proactive engagement on behalf of Trust contributors.\n\nThe snapshot vote concluded with 381 voters and 60M DYDX in agreement (100%). The vote results have shown significant support for the program.\n[https://forums.dydx.community/snapshot/dydxgov.eth/0x65a5a0c35c41994ecee0d472a4e93d9aa3392c790153ed1c4f2fd83133c73b68](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0xad51ba7f87aff4434e0587192c3c90c794f97bdb3a478d6a25ea259dccfadfd0)\n\n**Relevant Links**\n\nDGP website: https://dydxgrants.com/\n\nDRC discussion: https://dydx.forum/t/dydx-grants-program-v1-5-extension/781\n\n## Motivation\n\nFollowing on the success of the dYdX Grants Program v1.5, the goal is to continue funding grants that drive value and impact to the dYdX protocol, with specific focus on benefiting the transition to dYdX v4.\nThe program will focus funding efforts on protocol infrastructure (to support the new dYdX v4 protocol), MEV research and mitigation (to protect users from harmful MEV on v4), staking tools and resources (to support a smooth introduction of validators and staking activity), and additional targets on community growth.\n\nThe program will be restructure to include two funding categories:\n- Community initiatives: grants that impact community growth and ecosystem development\n- Strategic initiatives: grants that impact the protocol and infrastructure development\n\nThe introduction of two distinct funding categories, led by different Grantor teams, hopes to improve the grant selection process and its efficiency. Grantors will specialize in their initiatives to deliver the most impact to dYdX.\nThe addition of a separate Operator role will also improve the overall controls and operational efficiency of the program.\nReplacing four of the existing Trustees with new contributors that have more relevant knowledge and experience of both the dYdX and Cosmos ecosystems will improve the Grant approval process. Given that Reverie will transition to a Grantor role, appointing a new Enforcer will also improve the integrity of the dYdX Grants Trust.\n\n## Specification\n\n**Program Design**\n\n* $2M funding in DYDX\n* 6 months period\n* Reverie leading Strategic Initiatives\n* RoboMcGobo and an additional grantor leading Community Initiatives\n* Lemma Solutions as Operator\n* 5 Trustees\n* 1 Enforcer\n\n**Budget**\n\nThe existing [budget](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFa3811E5C92358133330f9F787980ba1e8E0D99a) of ~$2M will be used for the next six months. The program will naturally expire if the budget is depleted ahead of the six month period.\nThe program will diversify up to 75% of the DYDX on hand to USDC to further secure the operational runway and ensure adequate funding for U.S. based grantees.\n\n$336,000 of the budget will be allocated to compensation for contributors and operational expenses for the program.\n\n**Contributors**\n\nReverie Reserves, LLC will be appointed to run the Strategic Initiatives bucket.\nRoboMcGobo along with an additional contributor will be appointed to run the Community Initiatives bucket. The new Trustees will run a separate selection process for the additional grantor.\nLemma Solutions will be appointed to serve the Operator role.\n\n**dYdX Grants Trust Changes**\n\nThe following changes will be conducted on the dYdX Grants Trust:\n\n**Trustees**\n\n_1. Remove_\n\n- GFX Labs, Inc.\n- Scalar Capital Management, LLC\n- Matthew Ryan Dobel\n- Alexios Valonasis\n\n_2. Appoint_\n\n- Felix Lutsch\n- Abra Tusz\n- Colin Chan\n- Bora Nam\n\n**Enforcer**\n\n_1. Remove_\n\n- Reverie Reserves, LLC\n\n_2. Appoint_\n\n- Cliffton Lee\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe community has addressed certain concerns and issues with a v1.5 of the Grants program in the DRC, but overall consensus has been in strong support of launching. The program will work to improve the success of the dYdX v4 transition while growing both the user base and community through ecosystem initiatives.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

On August 3, 2023, dYdX Foundation published [“Exploring the Future of DYDX: A take on the Potential Migration of DYDX from Ethereum to the dYdX Chain”](https://dydx.foundation/blog/exploring-the-future-of-dydx) and explained that, as a Proof-of-Stake blockchain network, the dYdX Chain, if and when deployed on mainnet, will require a Layer 1 (“L1”) protocol token for staking to validators in order to secure the chain and for stakers of the L1 token to govern the network.\n\nAs a result, the dYdX Foundation announced that it commissioned the development of an Ethereum Smart Contract that, if deployed, could enable a permissionless and autonomous one-way bridge for the DYDX token to be migrated from Ethereum to the dYdX Chain. In return for bridging, users will receive wethDYDX which could have the same governance and utility functions as Ethereum-based DYDX (“ethDYDX”) on dYdX v3.\n\nThe Snapshot vote was held to establish alignment about:\n1.\tThe dYdX community adopting the dYdX v4 open-source software (if and when deployed on mainnet) as the next version of the dYdX protocol,\n2.\tThe dYdX community adopting DYDX as the L1 token of the dYdX Chain (if and when deployed on mainnet),\n3.\tThe dYdX community adopting the Ethereum smart contract (the “Ethereum Smart Contract”) commissioned by the dYdX Foundation that, if deployed, could enable a permissionless and autonomous one-way bridge for the DYDX token to be migrated from Ethereum to the dYdX Chain, and\n4.\tThe dYdX community recommending that dYdX Chain validators should reference the Ethereum Smart Contract commissioned by the dYdX Foundation when distributing DYDX on the dYdX Chain. \n\nSeparately, in reference to the [proposal lifecycle](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/dip-proposal-lifecycle), the off-chain Snapshot vote served as sentiment signalling and a necessary step before the creation of an on-chain vote to potentially give wethDYDX the same governance and utility functions as Ethereum-based DYDX (“ethDYDX”) on dYdX v3. Such an on-chain vote would require updating the GovernanceStrategy smart contract to include wethDYDX and change the way that voting power and proposal power are counted. \n\n## Specification\n\n1.\tThe dYdX community will adopt the dYdX v4 open-source software (if and when deployed on mainnet) as the next version of the dYdX protocol (Snapshot),\n2.\tThe dYdX community will adopt DYDX as the L1 token of the dYdX Chain (if and when deployed on mainnet) (Snapshot),\n3.\tThe dYdX community will adopt the Ethereum smart contract (the “Ethereum Smart Contract”) commissioned by the dYdX Foundation that, if deployed, could enable a permissionless and autonomous one-way bridge for the DYDX token to be migrated from Ethereum to the dYdX Chain (Snapshot),\n4.\tThe dYdX community is recommending that dYdX Chain validators should reference the Ethereum Smart Contract commissioned by the dYdX Foundation when distributing DYDX on the dYdX Chain (Snapshot)\n\n## Implementation\n\nProposal items 1-4 do not require any smart contract changes and as such, can be ratified by a Snapshot vote.

Specifically, updating dYdX v3’s governance contracts - replacing the GovernanceStrategy Smart Contract with the GovernanceStrategyV2 Smart Contract -  such that wethDYDX can be used for voting and proposal power purposes akin to ethDYDX in dYdX v3.\n\n## Abstract\n\nOn August 3, the dYdX Foundation published “*[Exploring the Future of DYDX](https://dydx.foundation/blog/exploring-the-future-of-dydx)*”. In that blog post the dYdX Foundation explained that it commissioned the development of an Ethereum Smart contract (the “wethDYDX Smart Contract”) that could enable a potential migration of DYDX from Ethereum to the dYdX Chain (If and when deployed). \n\nWhen interacted with, the wethDYDX Smart Contract would carry out the following functions in a fully permissionless and automated manner:\n\nStep 1: Receive and permanently lock the Ethereum-based DYDX tokens sent by the user to the wethDYDX Smart Contract; \n\nStep 2: Send a wrapped version of the Ethereum-based DYDX token (“wethDYDX”) to the user on a 1-1 proportional basis on Ethereum; and\n\nStep 3: dYdX Chain validators can also read and ingest the information in the wethDYDX Smart Contract such that corresponding DYDX can be distributed to users by validators on the dYdX Chain (if and when deployed) once there is confirmation that Step 1 above is complete and the Ethereum-based DYDX is permanently locked in the wethDYDX Smart Contract.\n\n\n\nWhile users who interact with the wethDYDX Smart Contract after the potential genesis of the dYdX Chain will receive native DYDX on the new dYdX Chain (V4), dYdX V3 is expected to continue to operate in parallel and therefore, will still need a governance token. wethDYDX is intended to serve this purpose by allowing wethDYDX holders to vote and create proposals with the token akin to ethDYDX.\n\nOn August 29 2023, there was a [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x17026e18317dc29fe745d3130246a83b1485612da9c97e7261e8f659cf33663c) to gauge the community’s sentiment towards such a change. The vote passed with 36,376,631.84 DYDX (99.99% of total votes) in favor of the changes and 43 DYDX were opposed.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe potential mainnet launch of the dYdX Chain is quickly approaching. On August 3, 2023, dYdX Foundation published “*[Exploring the Future of DYDX: A take on the Potential Migration of DYDX from Ethereum to the dYdX Chain](https://dydx.foundation/blog/exploring-the-future-of-dydx)*” and presented that, as a Proof-of-Stake blockchain network, the dYdX Chain, if and when deployed on mainnet, will require a Layer 1 (“L1”) protocol token for staking to validators in order to secure the chain and for stakers of the L1 token to govern the network.\n\nIn parallel, the dYdX Foundation announced that it commissioned the development of an Ethereum smart contract that, if deployed, would enable a permissionless and autonomous one-way bridge for the DYDX token to be migrated from Ethereum to the dYdX Chain (if and when deployed). \n\nOn September 12 2023, the dYdX Foundation published an “*[Update on the Potential Migration of DYDX from Ethereum to the dYdX Chain](https://dydx.foundation/blog/update-on-exploring-the-future-of-dydx)*” and explained that (1) the wethDYDX Smart Contract commissioned by the dYdX Foundation was completed, (2) in connection with a potential migration of DYDX from Ethereum to the dYdX Chain, the dYdX Foundation also commissioned the development of a GovernanceStrategyV2 smart contract (the “GovernanceStrategyV2 Smart Contract”) that, if deployed and if the dYdX community decided through dYdX governance, could enable the wrapped version of the Ethereum-based DYDX token (“wethDYDX”) to have the same governance and utility functions as Ethereum-based DYDX (hereinafter “ethDYDX”) in dYdX v3.\n\nThis on-chain vote ratifies the acceptance of wethDYDX as a recognised token within dYdX V3’s governance system. This is particularly important as we expect an increasing number of ethDYDX to be permanently locked over time which could have adverse implications for V3’s governance. By accepting wethDYDX as a recognised governance token we can help avoid such adverse events and ensure that V3’s governance system remains robust.\n\n## Specification\n\nWrapped Ethereum DYDX (wethDYDX) is a transferable ERC-20 token based on Ethereum Mainnet that is issued 1:1 when ethDYDX tokens are sent to the wethDYDX Smart Contract.\n\nThe [wethDYDX Smart Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x46b2deae6eff3011008ea27ea36b7c27255ddfa9) and the [GovernanceStrategyV2 Smart Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc2f5f3505910da80f0592a3cc023881c50b16505) have been deployed on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nethDYDX holders should only consider sending ethDYDX to the wethDYDX Smart Contract if and when the corresponding governance proposal is executed on-chain. Otherwise, a user sending its ethDYDX to the wethDYDX Smart Contract before such governance proposal is adopted and implemented would receive wethDYDX before the governance or utility functions of that token in dYdX v3 are known or confirmed. Users should also refrain from interacting with the wethDYDX Smart Contract without proper knowledge of how to derive private keys on the dYdX Chain (if and when deployed on mainnet).\n\nUpon a successful on-chain vote, a user holding wethDYDX will be able to participate in dYdX V3 governance (voting and proposing).\n\n## Test Cases\n\nA full suite of test cases is provided in the implementation found [here](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/test/misc/upgrade-governance-strategy-v2.spec.ts).\n\n## Implementation\n\nTo implement wethDYDX within dYdX v3 Governance, the [Governance Strategy](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/resources/technical-overview) contract must be updated to [GovernanceStrategyV2](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/governance/strategy/GovernanceStrategyV2.sol). The “setGovernanceStrategy” function must then be called within the [DydxGovernor](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/resources/technical-overview) which is owned by the Long Timelock Executor. Next, the GovernanceStrategy contract should be set to the address of the new [GovernanceStrategyV2](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/governance/strategy/GovernanceStrategyV2.sol) contract.\n\nThe on-chain proposal to be voted on by governance will include the following transaction to be executed via the [Long Timelock](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters):\n\nCall the setGovernanceStrategy function within the Dydxgovernor contract and set the contract address to the newly deployed GovernanceStrategyV2 contract.\n\nA full implementation of the proposed changes can be found [here](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/test/migrations/upgrade-governance-strategy-v2.ts).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThe dYdX Operations Trust (DOT 2.0) proposed the following:\n\nAn amendment to the dYdX Operations Trust Instrument that requires all Trustees to operate compliantly with all laws, regulations, and rules applicable to their duties and obligations as described in the Trust Instrument.\nAn amendment to the dYdX Operations Trust Instrument that updates the “PURPOSES” of the Trust to reflect the mandate approved by the community in this [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x51659bfec4948e80c0b85316d3098e62ab085a95033f1c0fe6bcc72db3ebe814).\n\n## Abstract\n\nFollowing the successful [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x51659bfec4948e80c0b85316d3098e62ab085a95033f1c0fe6bcc72db3ebe814) to extend and fund the operations of the dYdX Operations Trust (DOT 2.0), the [original Trust Instrument](https://drive.google.com/file/d/127DYP3MFt5PLdjxK0hHOrLeNWSNug75r/view?usp=sharing) was [amended](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rVYm_fAduBEQz8U7Pvfc1za4s_dqmFWT/view?usp=sharing) to reflect the [DOT 2.0 mandate](https://dydx.community/dashboard/proposal/13) approved through dYdX governance by the dYdX community. \n\nFurthermore, after discussing with legal counsel it was recommended to add a clause that requires all Trustees to operate in compliance with all laws, regulations, and rules applicable to their duties under the Trust Instrument.\n\nThe dYdX community has approved this proposal via a [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x46c40ddea980c824fd7787f9b73b6b1a842162dee8d155ad08a4d90a93dd333e) with 12M DYDX (99.5% of total votes) in favor of the proposal and 5.5k DYDX against the proposal.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nDOT 2.0 is a significant evolution from DOT 1.0 as described in the DOT 2.0 [mandate](https://dydx.forum/t/drc-amendments-to-the-dydx-operations-trust-instrument/1054) and therefore, an amendment to the original Trust Instrument was required.\n\nSeparately, we have included a provision that requires all Trustees to operate in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to their duties under the Trust. This was not clearly stated in the previous version of the Trust Instrument.\n\n## Specification\n\nWe are proposing the following changes to the Trust Instrument - these changes have been drafted in coordination with our legal counsel.\n\nThe original Purposes section “Schedule 3” is drafted as follows:\n\n*PURPOSES*\n\n“*The Purposes of the Settlement are to:\n\n1. receive funds from the dYdX Community, including Ethereum based tokens, and retain the same unless and until they are required to be converted to cash or equivalents and/or distributed for the remaining Purposes of this Settlement;\n\n2. apply funds received from the dYdX Community to meet the ongoing operational costs and expenses, including (without limitation):\n(a) fees for professional services, such as lawyer and accountancy fees; and \n(b) costs for online service providers;\n\n3. manage administrative processes to support the Purposes listed at paragraphs 1 and 2 of this schedule 3, including (without limitation), opening and managing any one or more bank accounts in the names of the Trustees; and\n\n4. do all other acts and things that may be incidental to, or desirable, to further the above Purposes as the Trustees may in their discretion think fit.*”\n\nWe propose to replace it with this new version:\n\n*PURPOSES*\n\n“*The Purposes of the Settlement are to:\n\n1. receive funds from the dYdX Community, including Ethereum based tokens, and\nretain the same unless and until they are required to be converted to cash or\nequivalents and/or distributed for the remaining Purposes of this Settlement;\n\n2. deploy and operate the following for the mainnet deployment of the dYdX V4\nopen-source software (the dYdX Chain):\n\n(a) a website user interface;\n(b) an Android application; and\n(c) an IOS application;\n\n3. identify and contract:\n\n(a) an indexer operator for the dYdX Chain;\n(b) a user support team to support the dYdX Community with any issues or\nenquiries related to the dYdX Chain;\n\n4. apply funds received from the dYdX Community to meet ongoing operational\ncosts and expenses, including (without limitation):\n(a) fees for professional services, such as lawyer and accountancy fees; and\n(b) costs for online service providers;\n\n5. manage administrative processes to support the Purposes listed above, including\n(without limitation), opening and managing any one or more bank accounts in the\nnames of the Trustees; and\n\n6. do all other acts and things that may be incidental to, or desirable, to further the\nabove Purposes as the Trustees may in their discretion think fit.*”\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned change we also propose a further amendment to the Trust Instrument, stating the Trustee’s duty to act lawfully at all times explicitly. This was only implied in the original Trust Instrument. This clarification avoids any possible doubt on the necessity of the Trustees to abide by the applicable law when acting as Trustees. The proposed change is to:\n\nReplace the current section 9.1:\n\n\"*9.1 The Trustees shall exercise or refrain from exercising the powers and discretions vested in them as they shall in their absolute discretion think most expedient for the attainment of the Purposes.*”\n\nWith:\n\n“*9.1 The Trustees shall execute and administer this Settlement and shall exercise their functions under it:\n\n(a) in accordance with the provisions of the Proper Law of this Settlement and any\nother law applicable to the Trustees or the Settlement (as the case may be) from\ntime to time, and in particular, each Trustee undertakes to:\n\n(i) operate in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to\ntheir duties and obligations under this Settlement; and\n\n(ii) maintain or cause to be maintained in force all licenses, permits, consents,\nauthorisations and approvals required by any law, rule or regulation for the\nperformance of their duties under this Settlement, including, in each case,\nwith respect to any acts taken in the advancement of the Purposes (which\nshall, for the avoidance of doubt, include the formation, deployment,\noperation or administration of any user interface in furtherance of the\nPurposes); and\n\n(b) subject to the provisions of the Proper Law of this Settlement –\n(i) in accordance with the terms of this Settlement; and\n(ii) only for the advancement of the Purposes.*”\n\nThe full proposal drafted in collaboration with our legal counsel can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rVYm_fAduBEQz8U7Pvfc1za4s_dqmFWT/view?usp=sharing).\n\n## Implementation\n\nFollowing the successful [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x46c40ddea980c824fd7787f9b73b6b1a842162dee8d155ad08a4d90a93dd333e) of this proposal, a supplementary instrument of amendment containing these changes has been created and signed by all Trustees and can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rVYm_fAduBEQz8U7Pvfc1za4s_dqmFWT/view?usp=sharing). \n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nFollowing a successful [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x35ffe29ac42b5d42b493cadff77e8d53caeab98bef5cceb984847cd501974dde), this proposal seeks to implement the remaining steps to bridge the [Community Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe710ced57456d3a16152c32835b5fb4e72d9ea5b), the [Community Treasury Vester](https://etherscan.io/address/0x08a90Fe0741B7DeF03fB290cc7B273F1855767D8), the [Rewards Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x639192D54431F8c816368D3FB4107Bc168d0E871), and the [Rewards Treasury Vester](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb9431e19b29b952d9358025f680077c3fd37292f) to the dYdX Chain. Further, this proposal involves winding down dYdX v3 Trading and LP rewards.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to bridge the dYdX community’s vested and unvested ethDYDX tokens from Ethereum to dYdX Chain. To accomplish this, this proposal first upgrades the [Treasury Contract](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/treasury/Treasury.sol) for each of the [Community Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe710ced57456d3a16152c32835b5fb4e72d9ea5b) and [Rewards Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x639192D54431F8c816368D3FB4107Bc168d0E871) smart contracts to the [Community Treasury Bridge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5D8541e3078BE7c2D773185aD8C8b9ED5105E08c) and [Rewards Treasury Bridge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d0051943D4c72aF12D638c6b7253C71929A910A) contracts respectively.\n\nThis upgrade sets the `recipient` of the [Community Treasury Vester](https://etherscan.io/address/0x08a90Fe0741B7DeF03fB290cc7B273F1855767D8) and [Rewards Treasury Vester](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb9431e19b29b952d9358025f680077c3fd37292f) contracts to specified burner addresses for each respective vester, and enables the `bridgeTreasury` function. By effectively burning unvested ethDYDX, this proposal allows dYdX Chain governance to credit the community vester and rewards vester accounts on dYdX Chain with a corresponding amount of unvested ethDYDX.\n\nFollowing these upgrades, this proposal bridges available ethDYDX in the [Community Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe710ced57456d3a16152c32835b5fb4e72d9ea5b) and the [Rewards Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x639192D54431F8c816368D3FB4107Bc168d0E871) by leveraging [Community Treasury Bridge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5D8541e3078BE7c2D773185aD8C8b9ED5105E08c) and [Rewards Treasury Bridge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d0051943D4c72aF12D638c6b7253C71929A910A) by calling the `bridgeTreasury` function on both contracts, and setting the community treasury account on dYdX Chain as the recipient (`dydx15ztc7xy42tn2ukkc0qjthkucw9ac63pgp70urn`).\n\nThis proposal also winds down the dYdX v3 Trading and LP Rewards programs by gradually reducing the rewards emissions throughout epochs 30, 31, and 32.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to ensure that activities on dYdX Chain can be funded by dYdX Chain governance promptly. This potentially includes:\n\n1. Enabling the trading rewards program on dYdX Chain. Note, the activation of trading rewards on dYdX Chain is subject to a governance proposal on dYdX Chain.\n\n2. Funding the dYdX Chain insurance fund. Note, funding the insurance fund is subject to a governance proposal on dYdX Chain.\n\n3. Enabling dYdX Chain governance to potentially fund the [Launch Incentives Program](https://dydx.forum/t/dydx-v4-launch-incentives-proposal/1075) proposed by Chaos Labs.\n\n4. Enabling dYdX Chain governance to fund contributor grants, community initiatives, liquidity mining, and other initiatives.\n\nIn order for governance on dYdX Chain to be able to fund such activities, the ethDYDX sitting in the treasury contracts on dYdX v3 must be bridged over to dYdX Chain.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Upgrade the [Treasury Contract](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/treasury/Treasury.sol) for each of the [Community Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe710ced57456d3a16152c32835b5fb4e72d9ea5b) and [Rewards Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x639192D54431F8c816368D3FB4107Bc168d0E871) smart contracts to the [Community Treasury Bridge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5D8541e3078BE7c2D773185aD8C8b9ED5105E08c) and [Rewards Treasury Bridge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d0051943D4c72aF12D638c6b7253C71929A910A) contracts respectively. This will enable the `bridgeTreasury` function.\n\n2. Set recipient address to a burner address for [Community Treasury Vester](https://etherscan.io/address/0x08a90Fe0741B7DeF03fB290cc7B273F1855767D8) (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002`) and [Rewards Treasury Vester](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb9431e19b29b952d9358025f680077c3fd37292f) (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001`), respectively, to effectively burn all unvested ethDYDX in the Community Treasury Vester and the Rewards Treasury Vester.\n\n3. Reduce trading and LP rewards by ⅓ from Epoch 30-32 on dYdX v3. Given the date that the proposal could first be executed, there will need to be sufficient LP and Trading rewards for Epoch 29-32 in the rewards treasury. The dYdX community shall request that Chainlink make the following ethDYDX emission reductions on the following dates:\n\n\ta. Reduce rewards to the following values on Nov 21, 2023, 15:00 UTC (start of Epoch 30)\n\n    \ti. Trading: 1,054,795\n\n    \tii. LP: 383,562\n\n\tb. Reduce rewards to the following values on Dec 19, 2023, 15:00 UTC (start of Epoch 31)\n\n    \ti.Trading: 527,398\n\n    \tii.LP: 191,781\n\n\tc. Reduce rewards to the following values on Jan 16, 2024, 15:00 UTC (start of Epoch 32)\n\n    \ti.Trading: 0\n\n    \tii.LP: 0\n\n4. Bridge the vested balance of the [Rewards Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x639192D54431F8c816368D3FB4107Bc168d0E871) minus approximately 13,199,453 ethDYDX (for Trading and LP Rewards for Epochs 29-32 and allocated but unclaimed rewards) to dYdX Chain Community Treasury address (`dydx15ztc7xy42tn2ukkc0qjthkucw9ac63pgp70urn`) as the recipient. See the Appendix for further details.\n\n5. Bridge the vested balance of the [Community Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe710ced57456d3a16152c32835b5fb4e72d9ea5b) to dYdX Chain Community Treasury address (`dydx15ztc7xy42tn2ukkc0qjthkucw9ac63pgp70urn`) as the recipient.\n\n6. Recommend that the validators of the dYdX Chain credit the dYdX Chain Rewards Treasury Vester (`dydx1ltyc6y4skclzafvpznpt2qjwmfwgsndp458rm`) and dYdX Chain Community Treasury Vester (`dydx1wxje320an3karyc6mjw4zghs300dmrjkwn7xtk`) with tokens that are effectively burned from the [Community Treasury Vester](https://etherscan.io/address/0x08a90Fe0741B7DeF03fB290cc7B273F1855767D8) and the [Rewards Treasury Vester](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb9431e19b29b952d9358025f680077c3fd37292f). Note, crediting the dYdX Chain [Community Treasury Vester](https://etherscan.io/address/0x08a90Fe0741B7DeF03fB290cc7B273F1855767D8) and [Rewards Treasury Vester](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb9431e19b29b952d9358025f680077c3fd37292f) will require a dYdX Chain community governance proposal.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe dYdX community has expressed strong sentiment for winding down ecosystem incentives on dYdX v3 and enabling ecosystem incentives on dYdX Chain. This proposal addresses this by winding down dYdX v3 rewards and bridging available ethDYDX sitting on the dYdX v3 community and rewards treasury contracts to the dYdX Chain community treasury. The dYdX community through dYdX Chain governance may then (1) initiate community spend proposals, (2) vote to enable rewards on dYdX Chain, such as Chaos Labs’ Launch Incentives Program and the native Trading Rewards module, among other things.\n\nTo bridge ethDYDX from Ethereum to dYdX Chain, this proposal leverages the [wethDYDX smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x46b2deae6eff3011008ea27ea36b7c27255ddfa9). The upgraded TreasuryBridge contract enables and streamlines the process of bridging vested funds with the `bridgeTreasury` function.\n\nGiven that it is not possible to bridge unvested ethDYDX, this proposal instead sets the vesting recipient on both the community treasury vester and rewards treasury vester to specified burner address for each vester contract. By effectively burning all unvested ethDYDX, this proposal allows the dYdX community through governance on dYdX Chain to credit the corresponding amount of burned tokens to the respective vester accounts on dYdX Chain.\n\n## Implementation and Test Cases\n\nA full implementation and test cases of the proposed change can be found [here](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/pull/57) and [here](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/tree/master/test/treasury-bridge/treasury-bridge.spec.ts).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n# Appendix\n\n## Detailed calculations for ethDYDX tokens to bridge from the rewards treasury\n\nAll ethDYDX that is unallocated from rewards can be bridged to the community treasury on dYdX Chain. Note that to calculate the unallocated rewards, we can subtract the allocated rewards from the original total allocated rewards.\n\nThere were originally 450,000,000 ethDYDX tokens allocated to rewards. Specifically, the initial allocations were the following:\n\n* 25% of the token supply allocated to [trading rewards](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/rewards/trading-rewards).\n* 7.5% of the token supply allocated to [retroactive mining rewards](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/rewards/retroactive-mining-rewards).\n* 7.5% of the token supply allocated to [liquidity provider rewards](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/rewards/liquidity-provider-rewards).\n* 2.5% of the token supply allocated to [liquidity module rewards](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/staking-pools/liquidity-staking-pool).\n* 2.5% of the token supply allocated to [safety module rewards](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/staking-pools/safety-staking-pool).\n\n### Currently allocated rewards up to epoch 28\n\nAs of epoch 28, 205,165,433.5392799029 ethDYDX were allocated to rewards. Reasoning:\n\n* 173,204.7618238715 ethDYDX for safety module compensation ([source](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/18f2e9007831cab3e1c13cf8a29626ea4f416615/src/deploy-config/base-config.ts#L230)).\n    * Note this was taken from the rewards treasury.\n* 5,116,733.9553627416 ethDYDX tokens allocated for safety module rewards. Reasoning:\n    * The rewards rate was 0.1585489619 ethDYDX tokens per second.\n        * 25,000,000 total ethDYDX / 157,679,998 seconds of rewards, which is 65.1785708699 epochs.\n    * Rewards were allocated for 32,272,264 seconds. Reasoning:\n        * Safety module rewards began being distributed on Nov-20-2021 04:42:55 AM UTC, which is unix timestamp 1637383375.\n            * Note this was block 13649857 which contained the first safety module staking TX ([source](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x480c35631456098c0ec666cfa8e971eb970ea99a197f2b4e503b16cf99fc7216)).\n            * Note the safety module proxy admin was upgraded on block 13649826 as part of [this executed proposal](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfd332147899fd3ef1db62f262ffae92bbd7d18a5ed4e142eb0407a173dbf0453/advanced), but rewards were not allocated until there was a non-zero amount staked.\n        * The safety module rewards were set to 0 on Nov-28-2022 05:13:59 PM UTC, which is unix timestamp 1669655639.\n            * This occurred as part of a governance proposal executed on block 16069909 ([source](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf98e9d0e0017fce10217477e7fab414b2210e9eebe28f450a71619ac036ad7fd/advanced#eventlog)).\n        * 1669655639 - 1637383375 = 32,272,264 seconds.\n* 5,779,607.8220932898 ethDYDX tokens were allocated for liquidity staking rewards. Reasoning:\n    * The rewards rate was 0.1585489619 ethDYDX tokens per second.\n        * 25,000,000 total ethDYDX / 157,679,998 seconds of rewards, which is 65.1785708699 epochs.\n    * Rewards were allocated for 36,453,142 seconds. Reasoning:\n        * The first staking TX occurred on Aug-03-2021 04:24:01 PM UTC, which is unix timestamp 1628007841.\n            * Note this was block 12953339 which contained the first liquidity module staking TX ([source](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3c0830f88a05298765e89e3c591dd4fb9579ea13ca4181ddd78bd47b9042a640)).\n        * The liquidity module rewards were set to 0 on Sep-29-2022 02:16:23 PM UTC, which is unix timestamp 1664460983.\n            * This occurred as part of a governance proposal executed on block 15639536 ([source](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcda8c40f45aac4ef7f5d6aa5d82cb84e89057c03842b549c00151ffbae854a4e#eventlog)).\n* 194,095,887 ethDYDX tokens were allocated for trading, MM, and retroactive mining rewards up to epoch 28 (note, this doesn't include epoch 29 rewards since they aren't allocated on-chain yet).

This proposal aims to fix the Safety Module in as simple a way as possible.\n\n**Specification**\n\nThe Safety Module will be reset to a clean slate. Staking and earning of rewards will become active as soon as the fix is executed by governance.\n\n***Smart Contract Implementations:***\n\n* The new [SafetyModuleV2](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/safety/v2/SafetyModuleV2.sol) implementation will be deployed with the following changes:\n    1. A new initializer function which:\n        1. Calls transfer() to send all held DYDX to the Rewards Treasury.\n        2. Restores functionality to the Safety Module by setting the correct exchange rate.\n        3. Deletes data set by the original initializer, which is now garbage due to the shift in the storage layout.\n    2. Updates DISTRIBUTION_END to account for the delayed start to the Safety Module rewards.\n    3. Updates getRevision() to return a value of 2.\n\nThe on-chain proposal to be approved by governance will include the following transaction to be executed via the [Long Timelock](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters):\n\n\n\n* Call upgradeAndCall() on the Safety Module [Proxy Admin](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/dd1c396733a245ffb0faac15f657ace87d289b92/contracts/dependencies/open-zeppelin/ProxyAdmin.sol) contract, to atomically perform the following:\n    1. Upgrade the Safety Module to use the new implementation contract.\n    2. Run the initializer function.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nDifferent approaches were considered as to how to handle the funds that had already been staked. The “clean slate” approach of resetting the Safety Module is recommended as we believe it is the simplest and safest solution from a technical perspective.\n\nReaching community consensus and implementing a quick solution will allow recovery of the locked funds, and allow everyone access to the Safety Module staking pool. The Safety Module adds an important, additional safeguard to the protocol. It should be noted that Safety Module contract upgrades must use the long timelock, which imposes a minimum 18 day period (~1 day voting delay, 10 days voting duration, and 7 day timelock) between when a proposal is created and when it takes effect. In addition, long timelock proposals require a minimum quorum of 100 million DYDX (10% of the total supply) in order to pass. This means any solution will require broad community support as well as governance participation from dYdX investor token holders. For these reasons, it is imperative that the community approve this DIP in its simplest form as soon as possible.\n\n**Test Cases**\n\nThe Safety Module has a full suite of [unit tests](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/tree/master/test/safety-module) providing 100% code coverage. The proposed fix was simulated in both a local and forked mainnet environment. The test suite was then run, to ensure that full functionality will be restored, following the execution of the governance proposal on mainnet.\n\nIn addition to unit testing, thorough validation was performed on the mainnet state to ensure that we have a thorough and accurate understanding of both the current smart contract state on mainnet and the precise nature of the bug. This validation included checking all smart contract [state](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/test/safety-module/state.spec.ts) and [logs](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/test/safety-module/events.spec.ts), verification of the contract [bytecode](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/test/safety-module/bytecode.spec.ts), and detailed analysis of [storage slots](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/test/safety-module/storage-slots.spec.ts), including those that are not directly accessible by the contract. All test and deploy scripts are open-sourced in the dYdX Foundation [governance contracts](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts) repository.\n\n[Detailed instructions](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/safety/README.md) are provided on GitHub to allow anybody to run the same tests.\n\n**Implementation**\n\nA [full implementation](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/tree/master/contracts/safety/v2) is open-sourced in the dYdX Foundation governance contracts repository.\n\n**Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

The results of the poll are available [here](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/QmbJ5QxHr1pyShKTDaF5DjAr6vxQn8DVxshH2fyWgzDCBn). In aggregate, 575 DYDX token holders and delegates voted with 17,112,789 DYDX. With 413 voters and 16,682,487.634 DYDX (97.4855% of total) in agreement, there was an overwhelming consensus that stakers should receive 10% of their staked DYDX to make them whole.\n\n**Specification**\n\nUsers affected by the Safety Module outage will receive funds via a Recovery Contract. The same contract that was deployed as part of the DIP-1 implementation will be used.\n\n***Reimbursement***\n\nThere are currently ~157,459 DYDX staked to the Safety Pool from 56 unique stakers. These funds are recoverable by governance via the long timelock.\n\nThis DIP specifies that action be taken via the **short timelock** to withdraw the same amount of DYDX from the Rewards Treasury to fund the Recovery Contract. This allows the stakers to get their funds back sooner.\n\n***Additional Reimbursement***\n\nThose 56 stakers who were affected by the bug will receive an additional 15,746 DYDX, pro-rata, to make them whole. This will be paid out from the Rewards Treasury, and claimable by stakers through the same Recovery Contract. There will be no lockup on these funds.\n\nEach staker will need to call the claim() function directly on the Recovery Contract to receive their funds. They may then decide if they want to re-stake in the Safety Module.\n\n***Smart Contract Implementations:***\n\n* The [Recovery Contract](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/safety/v2/helpers/SM2Recovery.sol) will be deployed with a hardcoded mapping from address to DYDX token amount. This amount should include the amount that was staked by that address, plus the additional 10%.\n    * As a precaution, this contract will be upgradeable via the [Short Timelock](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters).\n\nThe on-chain proposal to be approved by governance will include the following transaction to be executed via the [Short Timelock](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters):\n\n* Call transfer() on the [Rewards Treasury](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/336cb686b0c50693639a0fdb639d0b8f3b0670b3/contracts/treasury/Treasury.sol) contract, to transfer ~15,746 DYDX to the [Recovery Contract](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/336cb686b0c50693639a0fdb639d0b8f3b0670b3/contracts/safety/v2/helpers/SM2Recovery.sol) which was previously deployed to `0xF3f6e3fad2D453ca0Ce3c8580ecBE801F04c5662`.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nStaked DYDX tokens have been locked in the smart contract since September 7, and remain locked until a fix is implemented by governance. Given that the Staking Module only processes withdrawals on an epoch basis (every 28 days), the staked tokens would have been locked at a minimum for the remainder of the epoch. The community generally agreed that it was reasonable to make stakers whole due to this error. Consensus evolved around the need to repay stakers for the amount they reasonably could have expected to earn by staking over an epoch, plus some damages. 10% of the amount staked for each affected address is a reasonable and simple policy.\n\n**Test Cases**\n\nThe recovery contract implementation, as well as test and deploy scripts, were open-sourced in the dYdX Foundation [governance contracts](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts) repository. The reimbursement process was thoroughly tested in both test and mainnet fork environments.\n\n[Detailed instructions](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/safety/README.md) are provided on GitHub to allow anybody to run the same tests.\n\n**Implementation**\n\nA [full implementation](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/tree/master/contracts/safety/v2) is open-sourced in the dYdX Foundation governance contracts repository.\n\n**Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nUpgrade StarkProxy smart contracts to support deposit cancellation and recovery.\n\n## Abstract\n\nWhen depositing USDC to the dYdX Layer 2 exchange, the funds are held in a bridge contract while waiting for the deposit to be processed by the L2 sequencer and prover. While funds are on the bridge awaiting confirmation, the depositor can initiate a time-locked recovery process to cancel the deposit. This functionality is not currently supported by the Stark Proxy smart contracts which manage the funds borrowed by market makers from the Liquidity Module staking pool. These Stark Proxy smart contracts should be upgraded to support deposit cancelation and recovery.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOn October 27, 2021 09:37:37 AM +UTC, we (Wintermute) borrowed 50 million USDC (transaction [here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa9cc82d4d8e6360538bb3c61e91a6c2494d98d7644d4516b0456a8008dad0e47)) from the [Liquidity Staking Pool](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/staking-pools/liquidity-staking-pool) and attempted to deposit the funds to our trading account on the dYdX exchange. We had to send deposit programmatically because the client provided by the dYdX Foundation team does not support wallet-connect yet. Unfortunately, the wrong “vaultId” parameter was passed in the call to “depositToExchange” (transaction [here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe6a1130a56abf62a076ef4210a28da20e06226295b54fc52b89a6b61850dca8e)). Because this “vaultId” did not correspond to our STARK key, the deposit was invalid and could not be confirmed on L2.\nThe 50M USDC are safely held by the dYdX L2 exchange smart contract and can be reclaimed by the StarkProxy contract. However, to reclaim the funds, the StarkProxy contract must call “depositCancel” and “depositReclaim” on the L2 exchange smart contract. \nUpgrading these smart contracts would allow us to recover the 50M USDC and ensure that other market makers can safely make use of the Liquidity Staking Pool.\n\nFollowing a forum DRC [thread](https://forums.dydx.community/proposal/discussion/2437-drc-smart-contract-upgrade-for-market-maker-borrowers-from-liquidity-staking-pool/), Wintermute launched a 5-day poll on Snapshot regarding the question of Stark Proxy upgrade. The results of the poll are available [here](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x3d62d5b77b2b9bd3ab1c42c296cc36ccf89f77bea22815081e785d5d28d32366). The Snapshot vote has concluded with 5.3M DYDX (99.92%) from 474 voters indicating consensus in favor of the DRC. \n\n## Specification\n\nWhen market makers borrow funds from the Liquidity Module staking pool they must do so via a StarkProxy smart contract which manages the funds and limits how they may be used. The StarkProxy borrows funds from the pool using a “borrow” call and then deposits those to the exchange using “depositToExchange” providing multiple parameters in transaction data describing which account should be credited. This deposit transaction transfers funds to the dYdX L2 exchange smart contract ([here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd54f502e184b6b739d7d27a6410a67dc462d69c8)) and, if a deposit is valid, it is submitted and confirmed on L2. If the deposit parameters are misspecified by the caller, it may not be possible to credit the deposit. In such a case, as long as the “starkKey” was correctly specified in the deposit, the depositor can reclaim their funds using the “depositCancel” and “depositReclaim” functions. This process is described [here](https://docs.starkware.co/starkex-v3/starkex-deep-dive/smart-contracts-1/public-interactions#deposit).\nSince “depositCancel” and “depositReclaim” are not currently implemented on the StarkProxy contract, it is not possible for those contracts to reclaim funds in the case where a deposit transaction is malformed and unable to be processed. \nCurrently there is one such invalid deposit of 50M USDC which must be canceled in order for the funds to be recovered and put to use. The deposit is invalid because the wrong vault number was used, and the vault number and stark key specified in the deposit transaction do not match.\n  \n**Implementation**\n\nUpgraded Stark Proxy implementation [Stark Proxy V2](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/stark-proxy/README.md) is open-sourced in the dYdX Foundation governance contracts repository.\n\n\n**Test Cases**\n\nTest cases for Stark Proxy have been extended to cover new V2 functions. It is open-sourced in the dYdX Foundation [Stark Proxy tests](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/tree/master/test/stark-proxy) folder. The deposit and cancelation process was thoroughly tested in both test and mainnet fork environments.\n\n[Detailed instructions](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/stark-proxy/README.md) are provided on GitHub to allow anybody to run the same tests.\n\n**Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

A Grants Committee, specified in the DRC, will control the multi-sig and\nadvise the lead team on grants. A list of initial RFP ideas has been published on the website with the hopes of inspiring future contributors. Applicants are\nencouraged to apply for existing RFPs or propose new Grant projects. The lead team will review all applications and submit funding proposals to the Committee.\n\nThe snapshot vote concluded with 314 voters and 18M DYDX in agreement (98.9%). The vote results have shown significant support for the program.\nhttps://forums.dydx.community/snapshot/dydxgov.eth/0xe77513bfec9f55b1d620d973af1c4da1266ceffd333cbb120bc54a9359d27a40\n\n**Relevant Links**\n\nDGP website: https://dydxgrants.com/\n\nDRC discussion: https://forums.dydx.community/proposal/discussion/2511-drc-dydx-grants-program/\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe goal of the program is to increase the contributor count and actively promote the growth of the dYdX protocol. While initial grants cannot directly change\nthe dYdX product or core development, Grantees will have the opportunity to impact growth through external tools and non-technical projects (e.g. Analytics dashboards, newsletters, governance etc..). This contributor growth will lead to improvements across both user experiences and the overall community.\n\n## Specification\n\n**Program Design**\n\n* $3m DYDX Funding per quarter for two quarters\n* 1 Full Time Lead\n* 8 Committee Members\n* Committee Member held Multi-Sig\n\nThe treasury will move $6.25m worth of DYDX to the Committee Member multi-sig.\n\nFunds will be used to reward Grantees, pay the Lead and cover additional program costs. Grantees will be subject to milestones that can determine compensation structure, with standard payouts being 25% upfront and the remainder upon completion.\n\n**DYDX Amount**\n\nThe amount of DYDX to be moved from the community treasury to the DGP Multisig will be determined using a 24h vwap of the trades executed on the most liquid exchange, namely Binance.com. Given it makes up roughly 30% of the 24h volume, the DYDX/USDT Binance market data will be used to derive a market price. The data will be pulled from https://data.binance.vision/?prefix=data/spot/daily/trades/DYDXUSDT/. The previous day's trades will be used to capture a full 24h window so as to avoid timing constraints. As such, we will use the following data set: https://data.binance.vision/data/spot/daily/trades/DYDXUSDT/DYDXUSDT-trades-2022-01-01.zip.\n\nThis formula will be used to calculate the price: Σ(Price * Volume) / Σ(Volume).\n\nFrom the data above, we find: $16,199,143.30 / 1,949,010.42 = $8.31.\n\nThe DYDX Amount to be transferred will be $6,250,000 / $8.31 = **752000.00** (rounded up to the nearest thousand for simplicity).\n\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe community has addressed certain concerns and issues with a Grants program in the DRC, but overall consensus has been in strong support of launching. The program will make productive use of treasury funds to promote the protocol and engage contributors. Promoting external tools and analytics dashboards, among other projects, will improve the product experience and should lead to user growth. The program will also attract third party providers and other institutional teams that can build bridges and relevant tools to improve governance and trading experiences.\nGrants programs have been successful to grow an active contributor base and benefit the underlying protocol. We hope to bring this same positive growth to dYdX with this program.\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nTo better incentivize utility of the DYDX token, usage of the dYdX ecosystem, and to protect the protocol through increased adoption of the Safety Staking Pool, the dYdX Foundation proposed to adjust the formulas for Trading Rewards and Liquidity Provider Rewards to both include holding of stkDYDX. The dYdX Community voted and approved these changes via a Snapshot vote that concluded on December 20, 2021.\n\n## Abstract\n\nIn response to a thread that the dYdX Foundation posted proposing these changes, a community member submitted a snapshot vote on December 15, 2021 to conclude on December 20, 2021.\n\nThe Snapshot vote concluded with 864.64K DYDX voting “Yes” and 1.54K DYDX voting “No.” 316 unique addresses voted in the snapshot. The majority of the community (312 voters & 99.82% of DYDX) supported to change the formulas.\n\nRelevant Links:\nForum discussion proposing the update: https://forums.dydx.community/proposal/discussion/2940-drc-update-trading-liquidity-provider-rewards-formulas-to-include-holding-of-stkdydx/\n\nSnapshot vote: https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0xfbcb8104dc469cae09727dea89577f89b37df784c3ef2715b26ab77e9ae15161\n\n## Motivation\n\nIt is quite clear that the existing liquidity mining programs have been extremely successful in incentivizing onboarding and usage of the dYdX protocol since its inception. However, the liquidity mining programs do not currently incentivize users to remain participants in the dYdX ecosystem. This proposal aims to address this issue.\n\n## Rationale\n\nBy including stkDYDX as variables in the Trading Rewards and Liquidity Provider Reward formulas, the community can better convert dYdX protocol users to become long term participants in the dYdX ecosystem and, ultimately, contributors to the protocol while further protecting the protocol from existential black-swan events via increasing the size of the Safety Staking Pool.\n\n## Implementation\n\nDYDX smart contracts do not directly control the liquidity mining formulas. If approved, the dYdX Foundation will request that dYdX Trading Inc. implement the changes in time for Epoch 5.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

The majority of the community (195 voters & 99.8% of DYDX) supported to reduce the threshold to 0.25%.\n\n## Relevant Links:\n\nSnapshot vote for DYDX holders: https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x785066561be1e5d170eb28960da5ef2643ee0d0c3d590fd797c028512cc6be43\n\nMaker Volume Distribution: https://metabase.dydx.exchange/public/dashboard/5fa0ea31-27f7-4cd2-8bb0-bc24473ccaa3\n\nDiscussions: https://forums.dydx.community/discussion/3683-drc-reduce-the-threshold-for-receiving-liquidity-provider-rewards\n\n## Motivation\n\nHaving a high threshold of 1% is worse for liquidity on dYdX. It excludes smaller and small-sized market makers from competing with larger market makers.\n\n28 more market makers would be included in the next epoch if the threshold had been reduced to 0.25%.\n\n## Rationale\n\nReducing this threshold from 1% to 0.25% will provide better competition for tight quoting and uptime (especially on alt pairs, which have had quite wide spreads) and should result in better liquidity overall across dYdX Protocol.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

This move will also help the program scale through off-chain agreements and payments to US based grantees.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",
