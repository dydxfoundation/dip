## Simple Summary

To better incentivize utility of the DYDX token, usage of the dYdX ecosystem, and to protect the protocol through increased adoption of the Safety Staking Pool, the dYdX Foundation proposed to adjust the formulas for Trading Rewards and Liquidity Provider Rewards to both include holding of stkDYDX. The dYdX Community voted and approved these changes via a Snapshot vote that concluded on December 20, 2021.

## Abstract

In response to a thread that the dYdX Foundation posted proposing these changes, a community member submitted a snapshot vote on December 15, 2021 to conclude on December 20, 2021.

The Snapshot vote concluded with 864.64K DYDX voting “Yes” and 1.54K DYDX voting “No.” 316 unique addresses voted in the snapshot. The majority of the community (312 voters & 99.82% of DYDX) supported to change the formulas.

## Motivation

It is quite clear that the existing liquidity mining programs have been extremely successful in incentivizing onboarding and usage of the dYdX protocol since its inception. However, the liquidity mining programs do not currently incentivize users to remain participants in the dYdX ecosystem. This proposal aims to address this issue.

## Rationale

By including stkDYDX as variables in the Trading Rewards and Liquidity Provider Reward formulas, the community can better convert dYdX protocol users to become long term participants in the dYdX ecosystem and, ultimately, contributors to the protocol while further protecting the protocol from existential black-swan events via increasing the size of the Safety Staking Pool.

## Implementation

DYDX smart contracts do not directly control the liquidity mining formulas. If approved, the dYdX Foundation will request that dYdX Trading Inc. implement the changes in time for Epoch 5.
