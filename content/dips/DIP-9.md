## Simple Summary

The purpose of this DIP is to implement a Guernsey Purpose Trust for the dYdX Grants Program to enable a number of benefits to both tokenholders and the parties involved in the program.

## Abstract

Following guidance from the dYdX Foundation Legal team, the dYdX Grants Program aims to implement a Guernsey Purpose Trust structure so as to solidify it's legal stature and allow for necessary scaling activities including selling of DYDX for stablecoins and off-chain activity.

The Snapshot vote concluded with 536 unique voters and a total 37,422,308 DYDX voted. The overwhelming majority of the community (531 voters & 99.07% of DYDX) were in favor of moving forward with this proposal.

## Motivation

This measure will help the dYdX Grants Program unlock a number of benefits, including but not necessarily limited to:

- Allow the DGP to sell DYDX for stablecoins without incurring tax liability, enabling payments to large providers and US based grantees.
- Increase legal protection for the Grants Committee as Trustees and Reverie as the Enforcer of the Trust.
- Allow Trustees (Committee members) to sign off-chain agreements on behalf of the Trust.
- Allow DYDX tokenholders to retain decision-making as to the Trustees, the Enforcer, terminating the Purpose Trust and transerring assets.

## Rationale

Implementing this Trust structure will provide full control of the Grants program to DYDX tokenholders while also benefiting all parties involved with increased legal protection. This move will also help the program scale through off-chain agreements and payments to US based grantees.
