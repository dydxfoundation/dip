## Simple Summary
The purpose of this DIP is to reduce the liquidity provider rewards threshold for market makers from 5% to 1% so that smaller and medium-sized market makers can be included as well.

## Abstract

In reference to a thread on market maker incentives, Su Zhu from Three Arrows Capital submitted a Snapshot vote to reduce the volume threshold % for market makers to qualify to receive Liquidity Provider Rewards. 

The Snapshot vote concluded with a record 764 unique voters and 55M DYDX in agreement. The majority of the community (399 voters & 86% of DYDX) supported to reduce the threshold to 1%.

## Motivation

Having a high threshold of 5% is worse for liquidity on dYdX. It excludes smaller and medium-sized market makers from competing with larger market makers. 

5 more market makers would be included in epoch 0/1 if the threshold had been reduced to 1%.




## Rationale

 Reducing this threshold from 5% to 1% will provide better competition for tight quoting and uptime (especially on alt pairs, which have had quite wide spreads) and should result in better liquidity overall across dYdX Protocol.
