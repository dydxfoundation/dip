## Motivation

Having the threshold at 5% is  worse for liquidity to not allow more small and medium-sized market makers to compete with the larger ones.


## Rationale

 Reducing this threshold from 5% to 1% will provide better competition for tight quoting and uptime (especially on alt pairs, which have had quite wide spreads) and should result in better liquidity overall across DYDX Protocol.
