## Simple Summary
This DIP is to reduce the threshold for receiving market maker tokens reduced from 5% of maker volume to 1%. 

## Abstract

In reference to a thread on market maker incentives, Su Zhu from Three Arrows Capital submitted a Snapshot vote to reduce the volume threshold % for market makers to qualify to receive Liquidity Provider Rewards. 

The Snapshot vote concluded with a record 764 unique voters and 55M dYdX in agreement. The majority of the community (399 voters & 86% of dYdX) supported to reduce the threshold to 1%.

## Motivation

Having a high threshold of 5% is worse for liquidity on dYdX. It excludes smaller and medium-sized market makers from competing with larger market makers. 

8 more market makers would be included in epoch 0/1 if the threshold had been reduced to 1%.




## Rationale

 Reducing this threshold from 5% to 1% will provide better competition for tight quoting and uptime (especially on alt pairs, which have had quite wide spreads) and should result in better liquidity overall across DYDX Protocol.
